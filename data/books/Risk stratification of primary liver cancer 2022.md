|                                   | models with good clinical         |
|                                   | validation values have been       |
|                                   | applied clinically, such as the   |

|                                   | PAGE-B model. Therefore, the      |
|                                   | Chinese, together with several    |
|                                   | research societies, have          |
|                                   | formulated the "Guideline for     |

> I have read an article with title: "Viral hepatitis and hepatocellular
> carcinoma: From molecular pathways to the role of clinical
> surveillance and antiviral treatment" with great interest\[1\]. This
> is a very good systematic review which fully discusses the etiology,
> risk factors, and pathogenesis of primary liver cancer (PLC). High-,
> medium-, and low-risk factors of PLC were analyzed. However, the term
> \"risk factors for the development of PLC\" in this article could lead
> to misunderstandings by readers.
>
> First, a single study or a small number of studies cannot
> comprehensively summarize the risk factors of PLC. Perhaps a
> meta-analysis is more reasonable. A meta-analysis of chronic hepatitis
> B hepato-cellular carcinoma (HCC) from China included 3165 cases and
> 10896 controls from 27 studies\[2\]. The results showed that, from the
> currently available evidence, Chinese people with a high viral load,
> not treated with antiviral treatment, with a family history of liver
> cancer, of male sex, and with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV)
> infection are at risk of developing HCC. In another meta-analysis of
> risk factors for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and HCC, 18
> studies involving 470,404 patients were included. In NAFLD patients
> before cirrhosis, the incidence of HCC was 0.03/100 person years. In
> patients with liver cirrhosis, the incidence rate was 3.78/100 person
> years\[3\]. However, it still needs to be noted that the risk factors
> of PLC that can be seen at present are for a specific disease, and
> there is still a lack of meta-analysis on the risk factors of all PLC.
> Many studies have analyzed PLC risk factors. Among them, the studies
> that have been highly recognized mentioned the Toronto HCC risk index
> (THRI) which takes into consideration five variables, including age,
> gender, platelet count, and the cause of liver cirrhosis (0, 0, 36,
> 54, and 97 for autoimmune liver disease, hepatitis C with sustained
> virological response \[SVR\], other liver diseases, fatty hepatitis,
> untreated chronic hepatitis C or chronic hepatitis B, respectively). A
> total of 366 points of the THRI model were constructed. The 5-year
> cumulative incidence rates of HCC in the low- (\< 120 points), medium-
> (120-240 points), and high- (\> 240 points) risk groups were 1.2% and
> 4.5%, 4%, respectively, and 15, and the 10-year cumulative incidence
> rates of HCC were 3%, 10%, and 32%, respectively\[4\].
>
> The THRI model was also validated in China. For patients with
> cirrhosis classified into low-, medium-, and high-risk groups, the
> 5-year cumulative incidence rates of HCC were 0%, 13%, and 34%,
> respectively, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic
> curve (AUC) of the prediction model is 0.707\[5\]. The significance of
> the THRI model is that even in patients with liver cirrhosis who are
> at high risk of HCC, it is still necessary to conduct further risk
> stratification to distinguish the extremely high-risk population of
> HCC.
>
> HBV infection is the main cause of HCC. Even without cirrhosis, there
> is only 6.5% chance of 2%-9.5% of HBV infected individuals to progress
> to HCC in their lifetime. Some scholars in China have built the
> REACH-B model with a total of 17 points, including sex, age, alanine
> aminotransferase (ALT) HBeAg status, and HBV DNA level, aiming at the
> risk stratification of HBV-infected individuals who have not received
> antiviral treatment; scores of 0-5, 6-11, and 12-17 are low, medium,
> and high risk, respectively \[6\]. The incidence of HCC in the lowest
> (0) and highest (17) scores within 3, 5, and 10 years is 0.0% and
> 23.6%, 0.0% and 47.4% and 0.0% and 81.6%, respectively.
>
> HBV remains a risk factor for HCC after antiviral treatment. Based on
> the 5-year results of oral antiviral treatment with entecavir or
> tenofovir in 1,815 CHB patients in Europe, the PAGE-B model with three
> parameters, including age, sex, and platelet count, and a total score
> of 25 points was constructed to evaluate the risk of HCC in patients
> with HBV infection after antiviral treatment\[7\]. According to the
> score, the patients were divided into three groups: low-risk (0-9
> points), medium-risk (10-17 points), and high-risk (18-25 points). The
> 5-year cumulative incidence of HCC in the low-, moderate-, and
> high-risk groups was 0%, 0%-4%, and 16%-17%, respectively. The Korean
> cohort verified that the PAGE-B model was equally effective in Asian
> populations, and the AUC for 5-year HCC predictive power was
> 0.77\[8\].
>
> The PAGE-B team recently added two parameters, age and liver stiffness
> measurement; thus, the maximum total score is now 15 points and
> divided into low-risk (\< 5 points), medium-risk (6-10 points), and
> high-risk (\> 11 points) levels. The cumulative incidence of HCC in 12
> years was 0.0%, 4.0%, 0.0%, and 13.8%. In conclusion, the 5-year
> cumulative incidence rate of HCC was still 5.5% in patients with
> chronic HBV infection treated with antiviral therapy, especially those
> classified in the high-risk group (7%-8.4%). However, the negative
> predictive rate of HCC in 5 and 12 years in the low-risk group is as
> high as 97.5%-100%\[6,8\]. In untreated individuals infected with HCV,
> serum HCV RNA, ALT, and HCV genotype 1b were independent predictors of
> HCC\[9,10\].
>
> Risk prediction models have a long history in predicting HCC incidence
> rate in CHB patients. Currently, approved models are as follows:
> CU-HCC, GAG-HCC, Page-B, mPAGE-B, REACH-B and mREACH-B\[11,12\]. A
> meta-analysis used six models to perform AUC validation on 22 studies
> published between 2011 and 2020\[13\]. The AUC values of the six
> models ranged from 0.715 to 0.778. In

> \[17-19\]. Scholars in China have followed up 22472 residents and a
> total of 362268 people/year, and 374 cases of HCC have been detected.

> first-degree relatives infected with HBV and HCV with a family history
> of liver cancer had a significantly increased risk of HCC in at all
> stages, which requires special attention\[18\].

> Third, untreated chronic hepatitis D virus infection was classified as
> a moderate risk factor in the analysis of HCC risk factors, with an OR
> of 3.9. HDV is a defective virus dependent on HBV infection. Chronic
> hepatitis D inevitably overlaps with chronic hepatitis B. As described

> form of chronic viral hepatitis, leading to rapid progression of liver
> cirrhosis and higher mortality. More than 10% of patients infected

> decompensation within 30 years\[20\]. Recent cohort studies have found
> that compared to patients with a single HBV infection, the risk of
> patients with HDV infection is nine times higher, although it is
> generally believed that HDV does not represent a major risk factor for
> the development of HCC\[21,22\]. In addition, persistent hepatitis D
> virus replication has been a risk factor for liver disease progression
> to cirrhosis and HCC\[23\]. A European study on the collaborative
> action of viral hepatitis showed that the incidence of HCC in patients
> with anti-hepatitis D virus-positive cirrhosis increased by 3.2 times
> compared with those with negative hepatitis\[21\]. Other recent
> studies have shown that patients with HDV/HBV co-infection have an
> increased risk of HCC compared to patients with HBV infection alone
> (adjusted HR = 9.30)\[24\]. A large study estimated that the risk of
> HCC in patients with chronic hepatitis D virus infection (RR = 3.9)
> was significantly higher than that in patients with a single HBV
> infection \[25\].

> Therefore, the Chinese, together with several research societies have
> formulated the "Guideline for stratified screening and surveillance of
> primary liver cancer (2020 edition)"\[26\]. China has a high incidence
> of PLC, and chronic HBV infection is still the greatest risk factor
> for HCC. According to the high-risk factors, the guidelines for
> screening at-risk populations were divided into low-, intermediate-,

Tan YW. Risk stratification of PLC

> alpha-fetoprotein examination (routine surveillance) is recommended
> every 6 mo for patients at high risk of PLC. Routine surveillance
> every 3 mo and enhanced computer tomography/ magnetic resonance
> imaging examination every 6-12 mo are recommended for patients at an
> extremely high risk of PLC. The surveillance interval can be extended
> every 1 year or longer for those with low-risk or intermediate-risk
> PLC because their annual incidence of PLC is very low. However, the
> cost-effectiveness of these recommendations remains to be evaluated.
> We believe that the stratified analysis of risk factors and screening
> recommendations for PLC in China can be successfully implemented by
> doctors to aid the early diagnosis and treatment of PLC. Of course,
> large sample verification and observation are required.
