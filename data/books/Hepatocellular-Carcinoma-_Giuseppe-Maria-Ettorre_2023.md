1.1 Incidence and Mortality

The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that, worldwide,
approximately 900,000 individuals develop each year hepatocellular
carcinoma (HCC), the most common form of liver cancer \[1\]. Overall,
69.8% of all HCC cases occur in males, with a male-to-female ratio of
2.66. Accordingly, HCC is the fifth most frequent incident cancer type
in men, the ninth in women, and the sixth in the two sexes combined
(Table 1.1). From a geographical perspective, the incidence of HCC shows
very wide variations. According to the Global Cancer Observatory (GCO),
part of the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), 72.5% of
all new cases of HCC occur in Asia, where standardized incidence rates
peak to 11.6 cases per 100,000 inhabitants/year. In Africa, HCC is the
fourth most common incident cancer, with an 8.8 standardized yearly
incidence rate of new cases per 100,000 individuals (Table 1.1). In
Oceania, Northern America, and Europe, HCC is less common than in Asia
or Africa, with the lowest incidence rate being documented in Europe
(5.2 new cases per 100,000 individuals per year) where HCC ranks
thirteenth overall among incident cancer types.Table 1.1Hepatocellular

With regard to mortality, HCC is, worldwide, the third most common
oncological cause of death: more than 830,000 persons die because of HCC
every year. Most of these deaths (69.6%) occur among males, with a peak
in mortality rates of 12.9 deaths per 100,000 people per year: HCC is
the second cause of oncological deaths in males and the sixth among
females (Table 1.1). Deaths caused by HCC are particularly frequent in
Asia, where HCC is the second cause of cancer death. HCC mortality is
also very frequent in Africa, with a mortality rate of 8.5 deaths per
year per 100,000 individuals (HCC is the third cause of oncological
deaths in the continent), whereas it is less common in Oceania, Northern
America, and Europe, where HCC ranks seventeenth among oncological death
causes, with a mortality rate (8.5 deaths per year per 100,000
individuals) 2.4 times lower than that registered in Asia (Table 1.1).

1.2 Prevalence

Prevalence is a statistical parameter that indicates the number of
people living, in a specific geographic area and period, after a cancer
diagnosis dating back one or more years. The prevalence of cancer
patients is strictly related to the frequency (i.e., incidence) and the
prognosis (i.e., survival) of the disease, and, to a lesser extent, to
various factors like population aging, time trends in cancer incidence
and survival \[2\]. In general, about 5% of the population is living
after a diagnosis of all cancer types combined. The number of prevalent
cases has increased at an annual mean rate of approximately 3%, an
increase largely attributable to long-term survivorship of patients with
cancers like, among others, breast, prostate and colon-rectum carcinomas
\[2--4\]. Worldwide, it is estimated that 995,000 people are living
after a diagnosis of HCC, i.e., 12.8 cases per 100,000 individuals. Most
of these prevalent cases are males (69.8%) and from Asia (73.6%) while
the proportion ranges from 6.1/100,000 in Latin America and the
Caribbean to 15.8/100,000 in Asia (Table 1.1).

Long-term prevalence has been used as a surrogate for cancer cure,
denoting disease-free survivors with mortality patterns resembling those
of a population group without cancer of the same sex and age. Patients
living after a cancer diagnosis include individuals under treatment,
relapse-free ones at excess risk of recurrence or death, and patients
who have the same death rate as the corresponding general
population---they also represent the so-called "cured cancer patients"
\[5\]. For European cancer patients diagnosed in 2000, the cure fraction
widely varies according to cancer type and sex. Among men, the cure
fraction ranges from 94% of those with testicular cancer to 4% of men
with pancreatic carcinoma while, among women, it ranges from 87% for
thyroid cancer to 5% for pancreatic cancer. Prevalent cancer patients
with HCC show the second lowest cure fraction, i.e., 5% among men and 7%
among women \[6\].

1.3 Survival of Patients Diagnosed with Hepatocellular Carcinoma

Overall, HCC is the second most lethal tumor after pancreatic cancer. In
the United States, data from population-based cancer registries
collected by the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER)
Program estimated a 20.3% 5-year relative survival for people diagnosed
with HCC. Relative survival is an estimate of the percentage of patients
who would be expected to survive the effects of their cancer after
excluding the risk of dying from other causes \[7\]. No difference
emerged in survival rates at each time interval between men and women.

Survival substantially depends on cancer stage at diagnosis, which
determines treatment options and has a strong influence on the length of
survival. In general, a cancer is deemed localized when it is found only
in the part of the body where it started (also called stage 1 cancer).
If a cancer has spread to a different part of the body, the stage is
deemed regional or distant. The earlier HCC is discovered, the better is
the chance of a person surviving five years after being diagnosed. Table
1.2 shows the distribution of liver cancer cases according to stage of
disease at diagnosis, and the corresponding relative survival
probability. In the United States, 45% of HCC are diagnosed at local
stage, 26% at regional stage, and 18% at distant stage; the
corresponding percentages of 5-year relative survival range from 35.3%
to 2.7%.Table 1.2Distribution of hepatocellular carcinoma cases by stage

At a population level, in Europe the survival probability of cancer
patients has been evaluated by EUROCARE---a large cooperative study of
population-based cancer survival. Overall, the results from EUROCARE
indicates that cancer survival is improving over time although
differences among countries persist. EUROCARE data from 107 cancer
registries for more than 10 million cancer patients diagnosed up to
2007, and followed up to 2008, have shown that 5-year relative survival
generally increased steadily over time for all European regions.
However, improvements in survival for liver cancer and other rapidly
fatal cancers (e.g., esophagus, pancreas, and pleura) were limited. For
liver cancer, 5-year survival was approximately 12% \[8\].

Similarly, population-based survival probabilities for patients with
liver cancer have been documented for England by the Cancer Research UK
\[9\] for the period 2013--2017. As shown in Table 1.3, 38.1% of
patients survived one year after diagnosis---a percentage drastically
reduced to 12.7% after 5 years. It is worth stressing the substantial
survival advantage of women as compared to men (13.7% vs. 10.7% at
5-year survival).Table 1.3One- and five-year relative survival for liver

In Italy, the relative 5-year survival of Italian patients with liver
cancer appears to be higher than the European average, i.e., 20%,
without significant differences between men (20--21%) and women
(19--22%), or among geographic areas. Interestingly, HCC patients who
survive one year after diagnosis show a 33% probability of surviving an
additional five years \[10\].

1.4 Main Risk Factors for Hepatocellular Carcinoma

The types and distribution of risk factors largely reflect the wide
geographic variations documented in incidence and mortality rates across
countries, and the higher frequency of HCC in men as compared to women.

Most HCC cases occur in individuals with a pre-existing liver disease,
in particular liver cirrhosis or fatty liver disease. Worldwide,
infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) are
the most frequent causes of HCC \[11\]. With regard to HBV infection, it
should be stressed that in high endemic areas---i.e., in Asia or in some
sub-Saharan African countries---about 8% of individuals are chronically
infected, and approximately 80% of HCC cases are recorded in people who
are HBsAg-positive \[12\]. In contrast, HCV infection is the predominant
risk factor for HCC in the USA, North America, Europe, and Japan \[9\],
especially in HCV-infected patients with advanced fibrosis.
Maucort-Boulch et al. \[13\] used data on the prevalence of HBV and HCV
infection among 119,000 people with HCC from 50 countries worldwide to
extrapolate data to countries without prevalence data. Globally, they
estimated that 56% of the 770,000 cases of HCC that were recorded
worldwide in 2012 were attributable to HBV and 20% to HCV. HBV is
thought to be the cause of two out of three cases of HCC in less
developed countries, and of one in four cases in more developed
countries \[13\]. Antiviral therapies are effective in reducing the
incidence of HCC, but do not eradicate the risk. Among patients with HCV
infection who have a sustained virologic response to interferon-based
treatment regimens, the risk of HCC is reduced from 6.2% to 1.5%, as
compared with patients who do not have a response \[14\]. Promising
results are progressively emerging from the use of direct-acting
antivirals to treat and cure HCV infections, which are associated not
only with a reduced mortality but also with a decreased risk of HCC
development \[15\].

Alcoholic cirrhosis is the second most important risk factor for HCC in
Europe and North America, the USA included. Alcoholic liver disease
negatively impacts on liver metabolism and the risk of HCC increases
with duration and quantity of alcohol consumption, starting from very
low doses (\<10 g/day). A statistically significant increased risk of 4%
(from 2% to 6%) for every 10 g/day of alcoholic beverages has been
estimated by the World Cancer Research Fund \[16\]. It is worthy of note
that the alcohol-related risk of developing HCC substantially increases
in association with several conditions, including HBV or HCV infection,
older age, and obesity \[17\]. Smoking and coinfection with the human
immunodeficiency virus can also contribute to the development of HCC.

1.5 Conclusion

Epidemiological data on HCC are an important tool to set priorities for
liver cancer prevention. High-coverage of HBV vaccination will be
transformational in HBV-endemic countries, but the prevention of HCV
transmission and the treatment of chronic carriers of both viruses
require actions toward new scalable solutions. In western countries, the
reduction of alcohol consumption remains an essential step for HCC
prevention.

2.1 Introduction

The process promoting the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)
is similar to that underlying other types of cancer. It is a multistep
mechanism involving a mixture of genetic and environmental factors.
Several exogenous risk factors are implicated in the development and
progression of HCC, notably hepatitis infections, alcohol abuse,
metabolic syndrome, obesity, diabetes and many others. All these
conditions favor a chronic inflammatory state leading to the deposition
of fibrotic tissue and playing a crucial role in the onset of liver
cirrhosis, which frequently precedes the development of the tumor. It is
indeed well known that dysplastic hepatocytes grow inside the
regenerative nodules progressively acquiring multiple genetic mutations
leading to the neoplasm \[1\].

2.2 Genetic Landscape of Hepatocellular Carcinoma

The understanding of the genetic landscape of HCC has improved over the
past few years as a result of massive advances in genomic technologies.
Next-generation-sequencing techniques have allowed us to obtain an
in-depth picture of the most frequently mutated genes in HCC. Pathogenic
variants in several genes have been found in HCC samples. The genes most
frequently mutated in this tumor, ordered according to the mutation
rate, are: TERT, TP53, CTNNB1, AXIN1, LAMA2, ARID1A, ARID2, WWP1,
RPS6KA3, ATM, CDKN2A, KMT2D, NFE2L2, ERRFI1, ZIC3, ALB, KMT2C, IRF2,
BAZ2B, UBR3, and others \[2\]. A recent study showed that alterations in
these genes can be detected also in plasma cell-free tumor DNA of
patients with HCC \[3\].TERT

The TERT (telomerase reverse transcriptase; MIM \*187270) gene
pathogenic variants are found in more than 68% of HCC samples and they
involve the promoter region in 44--59% of cases, representing the most
frequently occurring point mutations in HCC \[4\] and the earliest
alterations in hepatocarcinogenesis related to cirrhosis \[5, 6\]. TERT,
the catalytic subunit of the telomerase complex, plays a fundamental
role in maintaining the length of telomere caps. Pathogenic variants in
its promotor, through recruitment of the transcription factor GABP
\[7\], upregulate both telomerase promoter activity and TERT
transcription. While the reduced length of telomere caps at the ends of
chromosomes is responsible for DNA double-strand breaks, genomic
instability and cell senescence, increased telomerase expression is
involved in carcinogenesis \[8\].

TP53

Mutations in the TP53 (tumor protein p53; MIM \*191170) gene are
detected in about 35--50% of HCC cases. The transcription factor p53, a
tumor suppressor known to be involved in several malignancies, regulates
cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, senescence, DNA repair and changes in
metabolism, maintaining genomic integrity. TP53 alterations are
responsible for the survival of aneuploid cells, and they can cause
centrosome amplification and chromosome instability \[9\]. High
chromosome instability has been reported in HCC patients diagnosed with
TP53 pathogenic variants. The same patients also presented poor
differentiation status of neoplasms \[10\], correlating with a poor
prognosis \[11\]. A large number of TP53 missense mutations detected in
HCC cases are localized in the DNA-binding domain of TP53, leading to a
lower affinity in binding target genes \[4\].

CTNNB1

The CTNNB1 (catenin, beta-1; MIM \*116806) gene encodes β-catenin, an
adherens junction protein, acting as a signaling molecule in the
wingless-type (Wnt) pathway. Mutations in this gene cause an aberrant
activation of the Wnt β-catenin pathway occurring in 20--40% of HCC
samples \[12\]. β-catenin and Wnt-signaling activation can determine
genomic instability, which becomes more evident in association with
increased DNA damage or mismatch repair defects, frequently appearing in
HCC development. Transient activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway can
also induce TERT mRNA expression and an elevated telomerase activity in
different cell lines, supporting the hypothesis that these genes
interact in the process of hepatocarcinogenesis \[13\]. It is
interesting to note that mutations in CTNNB1 are reported to be mutually
exclusive with TP53 pathogenic variants \[14\].

AXIN1

AXIN1 (axis inhibitor 1; MIM \*603816) is a gene mutated in 5--10% of
HCC cases. Its contribution to tumor growth is related to the activation
of the Wnt β-catenin pathway \[14\]. Genetic alterations in CTNNB1 and
AXIN1 are mutually exclusive, probably due to their opposite roles.
AXIN1 is in fact a negative regulator of this cascade.

LAMA2

LAMA2 (laminin, alpha-2; MIM \*156225) encodes laminin-α2, a crucial
component of the muscle basement membrane. It is expressed in skeletal
muscle myoblasts and myotubes, where it promotes cell survival, myoblast
fusion and myotube formation \[15\] and it seems to play a role in tumor
suppression \[2\]. Biallelic germinal pathogenic variants of this gene
have been reported in multiple types of muscular dystrophy. Somatic
mutations of LAMA2, more frequently associated with other cancers, are
reported in 5--12% of HCC patients \[16\].

ARID1A and ARID2

ARID1A (AT-rich interactive domain-containing protein 1, MIM \*603024)
and ARID2 (AT-rich interactive domain-containing protein 2, MIM
\*609539) are mutated in up to 20% of tumoral tissue samples in patients
with HCC. ARID1A is part of the BRG1-associated factor (BAF) complex
\[17\] that regulates the chromatin structure mobilizing nucleosomes by
sliding, expelling or inserting histones, modulating the accessibility
of DNA to other systems involved in DNA transcription, replication and
repair \[4\]. It is considered a tumor suppressor that is involved in
the mismatch repair mechanism. The reduced expression of this gene is
associated with a poor prognosis and facilitates HCC metastasis
development. Hepatocyte-specific ARID1A knockout mice present with
steatohepatitis and HCC \[18\].

WWP1

WWP1 (WW domain-containing protein 1; MIM \*602307) is an E3 ubiquitin
ligase that plays a pivotal role in HCC tumorigenesis due to its
function in regulation of signaling involving Smad4 and EGFR. WWP1
aberrant expression in HCC is associated with a poor prognosis \[19\].

RPS6KA3

RPS6KA3 (ribosomal protein S6 kinase A3; MIM \*300075) encodes a member
of the ribosomal S6 family of serine/threonine kinases. Constitutional
mutations of this gene cause Coffin--Lowry syndrome (MIM #303600), a
rare X-linked dominant disease characterized by mental retardation,
facial dysmorphisms, tapering fingers, small fingernails, hypotonia and
skeletal anomalies. Ribosomal S6 kinase tumoral alterations interfere
with p53 pathways implicated in DNA repair and in maintaining genomic
stability \[20\].

ATM

The ataxia telangiectasia mutated gene (ATM serine/threonine kinase; MIM
\*607585) is involved in DNA damage checkpoint and repair, together with
p21, and its mutation rate amounts to 7% of HCC cases.

CDKN2A

Mutations in the CDKN2A (cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A; MIM
\*600160) gene are detected in 6--30% of HCC cases. CDKN2A encodes two
distinct proteins involved in the p53 and RB1 pathways, respectively,
and represented by p16(INK4A), a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor and
tumor suppressor that downregulates cell cycle progression, and
p14(ARF), which plays a role in MDM2 stabilization. The impaired
function of p16 can produce genomic instability, especially in tumors
where defects in DNA checkpoint control and in repair mechanisms are
already present \[21\].

KMT2D

The KMT2D (lysine-specific methyltransferase 2D; MIM \*602113) gene
product methylates the Lys-4 position of histone H3 and it is considered
a tumor suppressor due to its involvement in gene expression regulation.
The mutation rate in HCC is around 6%. KMT2D seems to be involved in
transcript elongation associated with histone H3K4 methylation \[22\].
Its mutations lead to genomic instability in genomic regions where early
replicating fragile sites are located. Constitutional heterozygous
pathogenic variants in KMT2D have been shown to cause Kabuki syndrome 1
(MIM #147920), a chromatinopathy characterized by peculiar facial
dysmorphism, mental retardation, postnatal growth retardation,
congenital heart disease and other anomalies \[23\].

NFE2L2

NFE2L2 (nuclear factor erythroid 2-like 2; MIM \*600492) represents a
leucine zipper transcription factor that binds to the antioxidant
response element (ARE) \[24\], preventing cancer development.
Dysregulation of the NFE2L2 gene alters its antineoplastic activity.
Somatic pathogenic variants are detected in about 5% of HCC. The
combination of mutation in other genes, such as ATM or TP53, together
with NFE2L2 alterations, has an additive effect in causing HCC genomic
instability.

ERRFI1

ERRFI1 (ERBB receptor feedback inhibitor 1; MIM \*608069) gene mutations
are found in around 5% of HCC samples. This gene encodes a cytoplasmic
protein that binds and inhibits growth factor receptor kinases and their
related signaling. The EGRF-mitogen-inducible gene 6 (MIG6) signal is
involved in the inhibition of the EGFR and HGF pathways and its
defective activity can induce genomic instability, facilitating the
onset of HCC.

ALB

ALB (albumin; MIM \*103600) encodes the most common protein in human
blood, which is produced in the liver and acts as the main regulator of
colloid osmotic pressure and as a carrier for multiple molecules.
Mutations in ALB have been reported in 5% of HCC samples. Experimental
studies have proposed that ALB alterations can contribute to oxidative
stress, while decreased serum albumin might have a role in HCC prognosis
\[25\].

KMT2C

KMT2C (lysine-specific methyltransferase 2C; MIM \*606833) pathogenic
variants had been reported in around 4% of HCC samples. This gene
encodes a tumor suppressor member of the myeloid/lymphoid or
mixed-lineage leukemia family and it mediates histone H3 methylation at
lysine 4 \[26\], being part of the ASC-2/NCOA6
histone--methyltransferase complex (ASCOM). It acts as a transcriptional
coactivator, playing a key role in epigenetics \[27\], especially in
genomic instability \[28\].

IRF2

Somatic mutations of the IRF2 (interferon regulatory factor 2; MIM
\*147576) gene had been reported in HCC with a mutation rate of about
4%. IRF2 is an antagonistic repressor of α and β interferon
transcriptional activation (an IRF1-mediated process). It is known that
IRF2 upregulation is involved in neoplasm development in mice \[29\], by
promoting cell transformation and genomic instability.

BAZ2B

Mutations in the BAZ2B (bromodomain adjacent to zinc finger domain, 2B;
MIM \*605683) gene have been found in around 3% of HCC samples. The
function of the corresponding protein remains not well known, but it is
thought to be part, as the majority of bromodomain-containing proteins,
of the chromatin-dependent regulation of the transcription complex
\[30\].

UBR3

The UBR3 (ubiquitin protein ligase E3 component N-recognin 3; MIM
\*613831) gene function consist in regulating molecules involved in DNA
repair and transcription. In animal models, this gene seems to
upregulate the Hedgehog signaling pathway \[31\], the alterations of
which have been extensively studied in cancer. It is known that
haploinsufficiency of Patched-1, an antagonist of Hedgehog activation,
induces genomic instability, promoting carcinogenesis. UBR3 alterations
can be detected in around 2% of HCC patients.

2.3 Hepatocellular Carcinoma and Mendelian Disorders

HCC is not frequently encountered in hereditary cancer predisposition
syndromes. At the same time, multiple mendelian diseases are known to
confer an increased risk for developing HCC. The principal monogenic
disorders associated with HCC are: alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency
(SERPINA1 gene), tyrosinemia (FAH gene), glycogen storage disease type I
(HNF1A gene), acute intermittent and cutanea tarda porphyria (HMBS and
UROD genes), hereditary hemochromatosis (HFE, HAMP, HJV, TFR2, and
SLC40A1 genes) and Wilson's disease (ATP7B gene) \[32\]. Similarly,
settings of medium/low penetrance single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
can represent a significant risk factor for HCC. Various SNPs in
different genes, identified through genome-wide association studies,
have been shown to have a possible role in HCC development (DEPDC5,
GRIK1, KIF1B, STAT4, MICA, DLC1, DDX18, PNPLA3, and TM6SF2 genes). In
particular, the role of specific SNPs of PNPLA3 and TM6SF2 has been
confirmed in studies conducted in a sample of individuals with alcoholic
liver disease but also in patients with otherwise healthy liver \[33\].

3.1 General Aspects

Liver cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths
worldwide. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) accounts for approximately 90%
of liver cancer-related deaths \[1, 2\]. The liver has considerable
capacity to remove gut-derived microbial compounds and pathogens from
the circulation and is involved in the detection and clearance of
blood-borne infectious organisms \[3\].

This is reflected in the multitude of innate and adaptive immune cells
in the liver.

Dysregulation of immunological networks plays a key role in the
development and progression of chronic liver diseases and HCC. In
chronic viral hepatitis, alcoholic and metabolic liver disease, chronic
inflammation and an altered immune response are all associated with the
development of HCC \[4--6\].

Hepatocarcinogenesis can arise from various different factors promoting
tumor antigen tolerance, such as decreased recognition of malignant
cells, suppression of immunity and chronic inflammation \[7--8\].

In necroinflammation, altered survival and proliferation signals are
generated and these result in cellular DNA damage. The proliferation of
damaged hepatocytes leads to neoplastic transformation \[5, 9--11\].

Pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6 and TNF which activate
transcription factors, play an important role in the development and
progression of HCC. Moreover, the innate and adaptive immune systems are
important in the detection and elimination of transformed cells; their
alteration is associated with disease progression (Fig. 3.1).

Fig. 3.1Role of immune cells in hepatocellular carcinoma

The liver is a major immunomodulator, its protective function being
liver-modulated immune tolerance. Liver immune tolerance results from
complex interactions between liver-resident cells and peripheral
leukocytes. The interactions are maintained by pro-inflammatory
cytokines (IL-2, IL-7, IL-12, IL-15 and IFN-γ) and anti-inflammatory
cytokines (IL10, IL-13 and TGF-β) \[8\]. Thus, understanding this
immunological network is crucial to identifying new and increasingly
effective treatments.

3.2 Innate Immune System

Several immune cells are involved in the mechanism of
hepatocarcinogenesis: macrophages, myeloid-derived suppressor cells,
Kupffer cells (KCs), neutrophils, dendritic cells (DCs) and natural
killer cells (NKs).

3.2.1 Macrophages

Macrophages exert a phagocyte function and play a critical role in
pro-inflammatory response and pathogen clearance. They also induce the
cytotoxicity of target cells, critical for anticancer immunity.

Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are mainly derived from monocytes,
from the bone marrow and spleen and they constitute the main
inflammatory cells \[12--15\]. In infiltrating tumors, TAMs develop an
M2 phenotype characterized by expression of immunomodulatory cytokines
(IL-10 and TGF-β) and poor antigen presentation capacity. M2 macrophages
produce tumor-promoting and immunosuppressive cytokines and growth
factors related to tissue regeneration and angiogenesis. In particular,
in HCC IL-6 and TGF-β promote tumor growth, IL-1, TNF-α and IL-6 are
involved in invasion and metastasis and TGF-β and IL-20 reduce the
anti-tumor immune response. TAMs M2 increase the recruitment and
development of regulatory T cells (Tregs) through the activation of a T
helper type 2 immune response \[16--18\].

3.2.2 Myeloid-Derived Suppressor Cells

In HCC, monocyte-derived macrophages contribute to the recognition and
clearance of senescent hepatocytes, preventing tumor development. When,
however, these cells acquire a myeloid-derived suppressor cell
phenotype, they support tumor growth. They suppress T cell infiltration
in the tumor and dendritic cell function and promote the expansion of
Tregs through the up-regulation of free radicals, arginase activity and
production of TGF-β \[18, 19\].

3.2.3 Kupffer Cells

Kupffer cells (KCs), the liver's resident macrophages, are involved in
chemical carcinogenesis-induced hepatocarcinogenesis. They are central
to pathogen capture as they clear bacteremia and recruit immune cells to
the liver. KCs express an array of scavenger receptors in order to
internalize pathogens. At later stages of disease, dying hepatocytes may
release danger signals (danger-associated molecular patterns, DAMPs)
triggering activation of KCs through Toll-like receptors. Activated KCs
produce anti-inflammatory cytokines in response to bacterial endotoxins
and downregulate the action of antigen-presenting cells \[20, 21\]. In
addition, KCs can be activated by hypoxic conditions stimulating
inflammation also by production of IL-6.

3.2.4 Neutrophils

Neutrophils are the most common tumor-infiltrating immune cells and,
when in large numbers, they are predictive of a poorer outcome.
Neutrophils can promote hepatocarcinogenesis by enhancing cell growth,
angiogenesis and metastasis through production of growth factors HGF and
VEGF. Moreover, neutrophils suppress anti-tumor immunity by producing
many pro-oncogenic ligands. In HCC, tumor-associated neutrophils
interact closely with KCs and recruit Tregs and macrophages, resulting
in immune tolerance \[22, 23\].

3.2.5 Natural Killer Cells

Natural killer (NK) cells are a key part of the innate immune response
against viruses and tumors. They exert cytotoxic activity and regulate
immune cell functions through cytokine release (IFN-γ in particular)
\[24\]. Their role is similar to that of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs);
however, NK cells react more quickly during the immune reaction and they
can also recognize target cells in the absence of MHC. This potential is
especially important because cancer cells missing MHC I molecules can
only be killed by NK cells \[25\]. More recently it has been shown that
NK cells participate in the adaptive immune response through crosstalk
with dendritic cells and T cells. In HCC patients, there is a reduced
presence of NK cells with impaired activity in the liver. There is also
a depletion in peripheral blood with reduced levels of IFN-γ secretion.

3.2.6 Dendritic Cells

Dendritic cells (DCs) act as a messenger between the innate and the
adaptive immune systems. DCs recognize, process and present tumor
antigen and are thus essential for the immune response against tumor.
Failed HCC-associated antigen presentation by DCs can lead to a weak T
cell immune response. This lack of function of DCs may be due to a
decreased expression of human leukocyte antigen class-I molecules and
maturation defects determining an alteration in cytokine production, in
particular a reduction of IL-12 production and an increased release of
IL-10 and TGF-β \[26, 27\]. Thus, defects in DCs promote immune
tolerance and are associated with the initiation and progression of HCC.
There are fewer activated DCs in the liver tissues of patients with HCC
and these are unable to infiltrate cancer nodules, resulting in a
reduced recruitment of specific lymphocytes. In addition, DCs indirectly
promote proliferation of transformed hepatocytes through their
inhibitory effect on CD8+ T cells.

3.3 Adaptive Immune System

Immune cells, such as T lymphocytes, are present in HCC and are crucial
in the surveillance and clearance of tumor cells. An abundance of both
CD4+ T helper cells and CD8+ cytotoxic T cells correlates with a
favorable prognosis in many cancers. CD8+ CTLs recognize tumor antigens
carried by antigen presenting cells (APCs) via MHC class I molecules,
and kill them by direct lysis or by secretion of cytokines (IFN-γ and
TNF-α). Many studies report a significant decrease in CD4+ T cells and
an exhausted phenotype of CTLs in HCC patients; these findings are
associated with poor prognosis. Continuous antigen presentation in the
liver in the absence of CD4+ cells and monocytes derived IL-10 induces
antigen-specific tolerance. A memory-like virus-specific CD8+ T cell
subset with features of T cell exhaustion has been observed during
chronic infection with HCV, persisting even after chronic antigen
stimulation ended \[28\].

A decrease in the ratio of T helper/T suppressive cells is seen in the
peripheral blood of patients with cirrhosis and HCC, while a high
CD4+/CD8+ T cell ratio is significantly associated with lower recurrence
of HCC after liver transplant. A subset of T helper cells, the
follicular T-helper cells (Tfh), supports in-germinal center B-cell
activation and maturation in plasma cells. Impairment in these cells
appears to be associated with disease progression in HBV-related HCC.

The presence of Tregs, a small sub-population of CD4+ T cells in the
tumor microenvironment, is involved in tumor cells escaping immune
surveillance and clearance. Tregs inhibit effector B and T cell function
after antigen response. Infiltrating Tregs gradually increase during the
progression of carcinogenesis.

We can therefore say that the progression of liver diseases correlates
with a dysregulated cellular immune response \[29, 30\].

3.3.1 Interleukins and Chemokines

Immune suppression in the liver is predominantly mediated by cytokines.
Liver immune tolerance results from interactions between liver resident
cells and peripheral leukocytes. This environment is maintained by
pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-2, IL-7, IL-12, IL-15, IFN-γ) and
anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-10, IL-13, TGF-β). As long as HCC
is a typical inflammation-related cancer, interleukin molecules can play
crucial roles in the development and progression of the disease \[31\].

Interleukins (ILs) are cytokines that regulate inflammatory and immune
responses. They activate and regulate immune cells and participate in an
inflammatory cascade. Th1 cells are involved in cell-mediated immune
responses, the Th2 cells in humoral-mediated immunity. Hepatocytes
express receptors for several cytokines, rendering them susceptible to
their action.

In the presence of IL-12 and IFN-γ, naïve CD4+ cells (activated through
MHC class II recognition) differentiate into Th1 cells, and activated
CD8+ cells. In the presence of IL-4, CD4+ T cells differentiate in Th2
cells. Expression of the Th1 cytokine (IL-1, IL-2, IFN-γ) in tumor
tissue is associated with a good prognosis, whereas expression of the
Th2 cytokine (IL-4, IL-5, and IL-10) is associated with vascular
invasion or metastases. In liver cancer cells, the cytokine milieu often
switches to a Th2 profile, which inhibits the tumor-specific CD8 T-cell
response, boosts anti-inflammatory cytokines and lowers pro-inflammatory
ones. The causative factor of this shift is still unknown. In spite of
these findings, we often find overexpression of Th1 cytokines in HCC.

The best known anti-inflammatory cytokines in HCC are IL-6 and IL-10.
They suppress T-cell activation and their levels often result increased
in HCC. These higher levels seem to correlate with disease progression
and a poor prognosis. Specifically, IL-10 downregulates the major
histocompatibility complex, facilitating T cell tolerance. IL-6 and TNF,
which activate HCC progenitor cells, are mostly produced by resident
macrophages \[7, 16, 18\]. IL-17, a pro-inflammatory mediator, has
pro-tumorigenic effects, promoting cirrhosis progression and HCC
development. It is associated with a poor prognosis. IL-22, released by
Th 22 cells, is high in HCC patients, a finding which correlates to
disease progression.

The roles of chemokines and their receptors in HCC range from promoting
to inhibiting tumor growth.

A family of small soluble proteins, chemokines by regulating the
recruitment of white blood cells play a crucial role in many events,
including angiogenesis, Th1/Th2 development, inflammatory diseases and
tumor. They seem to be strictly associated with HCC and correlate with
distant organ and lymph node metastasis, even though the exact mechanism
is still unknown.

High expression of CXCL12-CXCR4 is found in HCC and surrounding tissues.
The CXCL12-CXCR4 axis is implicated in angiogenesis, promoting growth,
invasion and metastasis, while the CCL21-CCR7 axis correlates with lymph
node metastasis. The CCL20-CCR6 axis is associated with tumor
progression; in particular, HCC cell lines with high expression of CCR6
correlate with formation of pseudopodia, augmented intrahepatic
metastasis and poor disease-free survival. The expression levels of some
chemokine receptors, such as CXCR3 in tumor-infiltrating cells, is
higher than in peripheral lymphocytes, suggesting a role in addressing
migration of effector T cells into the tumor.

Not all chemokines promote tumor growth. High expression of
fractalkine/CX3CL1 in particular correlates with better prognosis in HCC
patients, probably by the direct killing of tumor cells \[32\].

3.4 Conclusions

HCC is the most common type of liver cancer. It occurs in the setting of
chronic liver inflammation and is most closely linked to chronic viral
hepatitis infection (hepatitis B or C) or exposure to toxins such as
alcohol, aflatoxin, or pyrrolizidine alkaloids. Certain diseases, such
as hemochromatosis and alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency, markedly increase
the risk of developing HCC. Metabolic syndrome and NASH are also
increasingly recognized as risk factors for HCC. Deregulation of
controlled immunological network inevitably leads to liver disease,
including chronic infection, autoimmunity and tumor development.
Persistent upregulation of inflammatory signals due to chronic liver
damage leads to necroinflammation (activation of immune cells, altered
immunological, survival and proliferation signals and promotion of liver
fibrosis) and, subsequently, the induction of tumorigenesis.

The innate and adaptive immune systems are important for the detection
and elimination of transformed cells. However, this process is
dysregulated in necroinflammation, and anti-inflammatory cytokines
(e.g., IL-10 and TGF-β) suppress proper anti-tumor immune responses. The
study of these mechanisms is crucial, as early and sustained elimination
of the underlying chronic liver damage is key to reducing the risk of
HCC and end-stage liver disease. Furthermore, the highly immunotolerant
environment and tightly controlled protective mechanisms in the liver
make the development of effective immunotherapies for HCC challenging
\[5\]. The identification and validation of immunological biomarkers in
HCC and the clinical characterization of patients will be crucial for
the generation of favorable responses to novel immunotherapies.

4.1 Introduction

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is an increasing form of cancer: it is
estimated that, by 2025, more than one million individuals will be
affected by HCC annually \[1\]. HCC represents the sixth most common
cancer worldwide and the third most common cause of cancer-related
mortality. HCC typically develops on a background of chronic liver
disease or cirrhosis in 70--90% of all cases, but about 20% of cases can
develop in the non-cirrhotic liver \[2\]. All risk factors for liver
cirrhosis play a role in hepatocellular carcinogenesis, and liver
cirrhosis "per se" is a precancerous condition. In patients affected by
HCC, chronic liver disease or cirrhosis due to hepatitis C virus (HCV),
hepatitis B virus (HBV), hemochromatosis, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis
(NASH), alcoholic hepatitis, autoimmune hepatitis, primary sclerosing
cholangitis, and primary biliary cholangitis are the most common
underlying diseases that predispose to the development of HCC. Certain
drugs and toxins are also risk factors for HCC. Furthermore rare
monogenic syndromes, such as alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency, glycogen
storage disease type I, hemochromatosis, acute intermittent and
porphyria cutanea tarda, as well as hereditary tyrosinemia type I are
associated with a high risk of HCC.

There is geographic heterogeneity in the etiologic factors for HCC,
which vary across countries worldwide. HCV infection and alcoholic liver
disease are the main cause of liver cancer in developed countries and
the predominant causative factors in Western Europe, whereas HBV
infection is the primary risk factor in most developing countries and
particularly in most parts of Asia, South America and Africa. HCC
related to NASH is increasing worldwide. Some studies report different
prevalence rates of NASH as the underlying cause of HCC, ranging between
4% and 22% in developed countries, as reported by Michelotti et al.
\[3\]. In another population-based study, in the United States,
non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) accounted for 59% of HCC
cases, with a cumulative incidence rate of 0.3% over a 6-year follow-up
\[4\]. NAFLD/NASH is an increasing cause of HCC in developed countries.

4.2 Viruses and Hepatocellular Carcinoma

Chronic HBV, HCV and hepatitis delta virus (HDV) infections are the
traditional viral risk factors associated with the development of HCC.
HCV-related HCC pathogenesis is thought to occur indirectly via chronic
inflammation and oxidative stress with subsequent cirrhosis, while HBV
can have also a direct oncogenic mechanism, sometimes independent from
the development of liver cirrhosis.

4.2.1 Hepatitis B Virus

HBV infection is the cause of 60% of HCC cases in Africa and East Asia
while it is the underlying cause of HCC in about 20% of cases in Western
Europe. HBV can integrate into the host cell genome causing insertional
mutagenesis and leading to the activation of oncogenes. For this reason
HBV is associated with an increase risk of developing HCC even in the
absence of liver cirrhosis.

HBV is a double-stranded circular DNA virus. The incorporation of the
virus into the human gene causes inactivation of protein p53, a
transcription factor that suppresses tumor growth. The HBx protein of
HBV can bind to p53 forming a protein complex and inactivating many
functions of p53, including apoptosis. A p53 mutation is present in
30--60% of HCC patients. Furthermore, HBx sequesters p53 in the
cytoplasm and prevents it from entering the nucleus. Inactivation of p53
is one of the factors implicated in oncogenesis of HBV-related HCC. An
abnormal activation of the B catenin signaling pathway has been observed
in more than 60% of patients with HCC \[5\]. The activation of this
pathway is related to the occurrence of the stemness and drug resistance
of HCC cells \[6\].

Levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) are increased in the blood and
liver of patients with hepatitis B. ROS has an important role, as
demonstrated in several studies, in promoting HBV-related liver fibrosis
and cancer \[7\]. The risk of HCC among patients with HBV infection is
approximately 2--5% and the disease can develop even in the absence of
liver cirrhosis. The risk of developing HCC is reduced by approximately
50--60% in patients treated with antiviral therapy with virological
response (VR) \[8\]. But VR seems not to significantly reduce the
overall incidence of HCC when a patient has already progressed to liver
cirrhosis \[9\].

4.2.2 Hepatitis C Virus

Chronic HCV is the most common underlying disease in Europe, North
America and Japan. HCV is an RNA virus that does not integrate in host
cell genome and for this reason the risk of developing HCC is more
common in patients with liver cirrhosis. The risk of developing HCC is
lower but persistent in cirrhotic patients who have reached a sustained
virological response (SVR) after therapy with direct-acting antiviral
(DAA). The relationship between HCV infection and HCC has been widely
studied. HCV infection causes inflammation and necrosis of hepatocytes.
Cell turnover due to inflammation induces, through poorly differentiated
hepatocytes, dysplastic foci and lastly HCC \[10\]. HCV infection leads
to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and seems to alter calcium
homeostasis, inducing oxidative stress. Some studies showed that
excessive ER stress due to HCV replication, degrades p53 in the
lysosomes so HCV infection disrupts p53 function through activation of a
protein kinase \[11\]. Reduction of p53 tumor suppression can favor
development of HCC. High intracellular ROS levels, as in HBV infection,
seem to promote hepatocarcinogenesis \[12\].

HCV infection and in particular HCV core and NS5 proteins can activate
telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) expression and reverse
transcriptase activity. The increased TERT activity has been found to be
associated with HCC \[13\].

HCV can also activate the Wnt/beta-catenin and subsequent activation of
pro-survival genes, a pathway that has been shown to promote HCC.

In conclusion, HCV infection and in particular liver cirrhosis due to
HCV can predispose indirectly to the development of HCC, but other
direct mechanisms of HCV-related HCC oncogenesis exist and can add to
the risk for HCC development.

4.2.3 Hepatitis Delta Virus

HDV has not yet been included in the list of carcinogenic viruses, but
evidence suggests that the risk of developing HCC is higher in patients
with chronic hepatitis D compared to those infected with HBV. HDV
replicates in the nucleus of hepatocytes and interacts with several
cellular proteins, modulating their expression.

HDV may alter multiple cellular signaling pathways involved in
inflammation, oxidative stress, apoptosis, and cellular proliferation.
HCC associated with HDV was shown to be characterized by the
upregulation of genes involved in the control of DNA replication, and
DNA damage and repair. Genome instability due to HDV infection is an
important mechanism of hepatocarcinogenesis \[14\]. This genomic profile
is peculiar to HDV and distinct from that of HBV-associated HCC,
suggesting that these two viruses promote hepatocarcinogenesis by
different mechanisms.

4.3 Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease and Non-alcoholic Steatohepatitis

Over the last decade, NAFLD has become an increasing cause of HCC. NAFLD
is considered as the hepatic manifestation of the metabolic syndrome and
is closely associated with obesity and diabetes. NAFLD is not always
associated with an evolution towards liver cirrhosis, but at least
20--30% of patients develop liver disease with necroinflammation and
fibrosis. This condition is known as non-alcoholic steatohepatitis
(NASH). Patients with NASH have an increased risk of developing HCC.

NAFLD is characterized by excessive lipid accumulation (steatosis) with
evolution in some cases into NASH. Liver cirrhosis and HCC are
complications of NASH when this condition is not properly treated. It is
interesting to note that HCC is reported also in non-cirrhotic NASH
patients \[15\].

A meta-analysis has demonstrated that patients with diabetes mellitus
have a higher risk of developing HCC compared to non-diabetic patients
\[16\]. Overweight patients in a similar way have an increased risk for
HCC. NAFLD/NASH, as reported before, are the expression of a metabolic
syndrome characterized by diabetes mellitus, insulin resistance, obesity
and hypertriglyceridemia.

HCC associated with NAFLD/NASH could have different mechanisms. Hepatic
lipid accumulation progresses to necroinflammation leading to
hepatocarcinogenesis as a consequence of different conditions such as
insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia, dyslipidemia,
oxidative/endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, genetic predisposition,
dysbiosis in the gut microbiome and altered response of the immune
system. Insulin resistance leads to an increase in intracellular free
fatty acids (FFA). Elevated FFA β oxidation induces oxidative stress and
the release of ROS and of various inflammatory cytokines such as tumor
necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and leptin. There is a
link between oxidative/ER stress and progression to HCC. Oxidative
stress promotes carcinogenesis by activation of JNK kinase and
inactivation of the p53 tumor suppressor gene (TP53) \[17\]. Iron
overload is frequently observed in NASH patients and is related to
insulin resistance. Intracellular iron overload due to increased
production of hepcidin can induce DNA damage that may predispose to HCC
\[18\]. Other studies have also identified the role of the immune system
and, in particular of CD8+, CD4+ and Kupfer cells and of altered
intestinal gut microbiome in hepatocarcinogenesis in patients with
NASH/cirrhosis.

4.4 Alcoholic Fatty Disease

The prevalence of alcoholic fatty liver disease (AFLD) is increasing
throughout the world. About 26--30% of HCC can be attributed to alcohol.
Central and Eastern Europe and tropical Latin America have a higher
incidence of drinkers. There is some evidence that females are more
susceptible to the toxic effects of alcohol than males. It was
demonstrated that women have lower levels of gastric alcohol
dehydrogenase activity and for this reason they are more susceptible to
the hepatotoxic effects of alcohol. Furthermore, some studies have
demonstrated that Whites have lower ethanol metabolizing enzymes in the
liver, compared to Blacks and Hispanics \[19\]. Progression to cirrhosis
and mortality is higher in AFLD (36%) compared to NAFLD (7%). AFLD has a
similar mechanism of liver damage compared to NAFLD. Alcohol is
metabolized into acetaldehyde by alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), the CYP2E1
enzyme represents the major pathway involved in the metabolism of
ethanol. High cell concentrations of acetaldehyde and ROS are formed in
the cell. Acetaldehyde is a potent carcinogen driving the tumorigenesis
by the alteration of DNA while concomitant high concentrations of ROS
can activate JNK kinase with subsequent induction of carcinogenesis
\[20\].

Ethanol is also involved in "de novo cellular lipogenesis" with
following steatosis and excess of intracellular FFA. Excess FFA, as
observed in NAFLD, determines oxidative/ER stress, increase
intracellular ROS levels with progression to HCC \[20\].

In conclusion AFLD induces cirrhosis and promotes HCC through a similar
mechanism to NAFLD.

4.5 Hereditary Hemochromatosis

Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is an autosomal recessive disorder of
iron metabolism, with elevated iron deposition in most organs including
the liver, leading to progressive liver dysfunction and cirrhosis. HCC
is a complication of HH nearly always occurring in liver cirrhosis.
About 80--85% of individuals with HH are C282Y homozygotes and are at
risk of developing liver cirrhosis. Other mutations in the high iron
gene are C282Y/H63D compound heterozygosis. Excessive iron in the liver
may act both directly and indirectly to induce carcinogenesis. Free
intracellular iron, which is present when iron binding capacities of the
plasma transferrin or intracellular ferritin are surpassed, interacts
with H2O2 with formation of Fe3+. Superoxide anions can reduce Fe3+ back
to Fe2+. Increased accumulation of Fe2+ in the cytosol enhances
generation of ROS, whose toxic effects on proteins and DNA promote
carcinogenesis. HH patients have higher rates of TP53 gene mutations and
decreased p53 protein activity in the liver, thus facilitating
hepatocarcinogenesis \[21\]. Increased intracellular iron is also
present in chronic liver diseases such as AFLD, NAFLD, and viral
infections, contributing to the pathogenesis of HCC in other liver
diseases.

4.6 Autoimmune Hepatitis and Primary Biliary Cholangitis

In autoimmune hepatitis (AIH), chronic liver inflammation and interface
hepatitis are present which cause liver inflammation and fibrosis. While
early diagnosis and treatment avoid progression to cirrhosis, the
persistence of damage leads to liver fibrosis. A major risk factor for
HCC in AIH is cirrhosis, and cirrhosis appears as "a sine qua non"
condition for the development of HCC in AIH patients. A similar risk for
hepatobiliary cancer is present in primary biliary cholangitis (PBC).
The incidence of HCC in AIH is 3.06 per 1000 person-years while it is
4.1 per 1000 person-years for PBC. These data support the importance of
regular monitoring of disease severity in AIH and PBC, with initiation
of HCC screening in patients who progress to cirrhosis \[22\].

4.7 Wilson Disease

Wilson disease is caused by accumulation of copper in the liver, brain
or other organs due to mutation of ATP7B gene that encodes a protein
that helps in excretion of copper in the bile canaliculus. This results
in toxic levels of copper in the hepatocytes. Hepatocyte apoptosis and
mitochondrial oxidative injuries is the mechanism of copper injury in
hepatocytes. Due to the availability of chelating agents, life
expectancy of these patients has now increased. In some studies the risk
of HCC was low even in cirrhotic patients and this leads the authors to
state that regular surveillance for HCC is not required. It has been
postulated that a high hepatic copper level is protective against
hepatic oncogenesis. Based on animal studies, it has been suggested that
excessive copper accumulation might have a protective effect on
hepatocarcinogenesis. On the other hand, in the Long-Evans Cinnamon rat
model for Wilson disease, persistent copper accumulation resulted in an
increased risk of HCC which could be prevented by administration of
D-penicillamine \[23\]. Therefore carcinogenesis is thought to be the
result of liver injury leading to chronic inflammation and cirrhosis due
to chronic copper accumulation \[23\].

4.8 Alpha 1-Antitrypsin Deficiency

Alpha 1-antitrypsin (A1AT) is the most abundant liver-derived
glycoprotein in plasma. Hereditary deficiency of A1AT in plasma leads to
an accumulation of polymers of A1AT mutants in the ER of hepatocytes.
One of the clinical manifestations of A1AT deficiency is liver disease
in childhood and cirrhosis and/or HCC in adulthood. Mutations of A1AT
results in two pathologic genotypes called PiZZ and PiSZ. The PiZZ A1AT
genotype is associated with liver damage and high risk for HCC.
Accumulation of A1AT variants in ER may potentially induce multiple
signaling events related to ER stress. ER stress induces an altered
regulation of several genes driving proliferation and tumorigenesis;
furthermore there is a secondary activated mitochondrial autophagy. The
final results are liver inflammation and carcinogenesis \[24\].

Hepatocellular carcinoma imagingLiver Imaging Reporting and Data
SystemHypervascular lesionsLiver cirrhosisHepatospecific agents

5.1 Role of Ultrasound and Contrast-Enhanced Ultrasound

Ultrasound (US) every 6 months is universally recommended for
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) surveillance in all guidelines \[1, 2\].

The detection of any new focal lesion during US surveillance should
directly require a diagnostic "recall strategy" that varies according to
the size of the lesion. Lesions \<1 cm should be admitted into a
non-enhanced follow-up program based on US repetition at 3--6 months; if
the size remains stable over a 2-year period, the 6-month surveillance
can be restored. The "recall strategy" for lesions ≥1 cm is based on
contrast-enhanced imaging techniques with use of vascular contrast
agent, such as computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI).

Contrast-enhanced US (CEUS) has been observed to improve the
characterization of focal liver lesions with enhancement patterns
generally similar to CT and MRI and can be useful in the case of renal
impairment. US contrast agents (microbubbles) comprise an albumen or
phospholipid shell containing a stable perfluorocarbon or sulphur
hexafluoride gas. CEUS is not recommended as a first-line imaging
technique or for recall strategies in terms of cost-effectiveness,
because CT or MRI will be needed for staging, but it can be utilized
when both CT and MRI are contraindicated and/or inconclusive \[1\].

5.2 Computed Tomography Technique

Contrast-enhanced CT (CECT) or contrast-enhanced MRI play an essential
role in the diagnosis of HCC and do not require histopathologic
confirmation. According to the Liver Imaging-Reporting and Data System
(LI-RADS), the use of a multi-detector-row CT with a minimum of
8-detector rows is recommended, with an axial slice thickness ≤5 mm
\[3\]. The scanning protocol should include an unenhanced phase (to
detect hemorrhage/treatment sequelae) and three enhanced phases of
study. For CECT, an extracellular intravenous iodinated contrast agent
is used, possibly with moderate/high iodine concentration (≥350 mgI/mL),
administered at high injection rates (\>3 mL/s), with dose adjusted
according to body size indexes \[3\]. According to LI-RADS v2018, the
multiphase dynamic study of the liver consists of a first late hepatic
arterial phase (25--30 s after contrast agent injection with bolus
tracking), a portal venous phase (60--80 s after contrast agent
injection) and an equilibrium phase (2--5 min after contrast agent
injection) \[3\].

5.3 Magnetic Resonance Imaging Technique and Contrast Agents

MRI improves the detection and characterization of focal hepatic
lesions, in comparison to a CT scan. In addition, MRI performs better
compared to CT in the detection of HCC in patients with liver cirrhosis,
especially when a hepatobiliary phase (HBP) is added \[4\]. In
particular, a HBP was found to be superior to CECT also in guiding the
correct treatment decisions for HCC \[5\]. MRI of the liver is best
performed at 1.5 T or higher field strength \[3\]. The MRI protocol
includes T1-weighted in-/out-of-phase gradient echo (GRE) images,
T2-weighted images without and with fat suppression, diffusion-weighted
images with at least two b values acquired (0--50 s/mm2 and 400--800
s/mm2) \[6\]. The dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI scan can be performed
both with gadolinium-based extracellular contrast agents or with
hepatobiliary contrast agents \[3\]. The multiphasic MRI study is
essential for identification of the typical imaging features and
vascular hallmarks, which are defined according to LI-RADS v18 as
"arterial phase hyperenhancement", "washout appearance" and "enhancing
capsule" \[4, 6, 7\]. Hepatobiliary contrast agents make it possible to
investigate the vascular characteristics of HCC lesions and to assess
hepatocellular function in a single examination \[6\]. The most commonly
used hepatobiliary contrast agents include two gadolinium-based
compounds: gadoxetate disodium (Gd-EOB-DTPA) and gadobenate dimeglumine
(Gd-BOPTA).

5.4 Imaging Features of Hepatocellular Carcinoma

HCCs are generally arterial hypervascular tumors. However,
hyperenhancement ("wash-in") in the arterial phase alone is poorly
specific for HCC. When hypoenhancement in the portal venous or delayed
phases ("wash-out") is added, both the specificity and sensitivity
increase (Fig. 5.1) \[8\]. Early HCCs are, however, characterized by a
hypo- or isoenhancement in arterial phase imaging, due to their
incomplete neoangiogenesis \[7\]. Another characteristic imaging feature
included by LI-RADS among the major criteria for HCC diagnosis is the
presence of a peripheral "capsule appearance", histologically composed
also by fibrous tissue, which explains its late enhancement due to
retention of gadolinium in the extracellular interstitial spaces \[6,
9\]. Another characteristic feature of HCC, included in the "ancillary
criteria" of LI-RADS, is the "nodule-in-nodule" appearance (Fig. 5.2)
\[10\]. Vascular invasion is more frequent in progressed HCC. It can be
microvascular, if it is only appreciable on microscopy, or macrovascular
(Figs. 5.3 and 5.4) which refers to macroscopically visible tumor in
vein (LR-TIV) \[11\]. Both of them are indicators of a poor overall
survival and an aggressive biologic behavior \[6\]. The presence of
intralesional fat is very specific for HCC and this is well evaluable on
MRI T1-weighted GRE dual-echo sequences, with loss of signal in the
out-of-phase images (Fig. 5.5) \[10\].

5.5 Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System (LI-RADS)

The LI-RADS system aims to standardize terminology, technique,
interpretation, reporting and data collection in liver imaging for HCC
surveillance and is promoted by the American College of Radiology and
developed by an international committee of radiologists, hepatologists,
pathologists and surgeons. US LI-RADS v2017 is limited to screening or
surveillance in patients at risk for HCC, to identify HCC at an early
stage, when it is potentially curable. CEUS LI-RADS v2017, as well as CT
and MRI LI-RADS, should be applied in patients at high risk of HCC,
including in this category adult cirrhotic patients, patients with
chronic HBV, and patients with current or prior HCC.

The LI-RADS v2018 algorithm is articulated in successive diagnostic
steps directed first to the identification of diagnoses other than HCC
(LR-1, LR-2, LR-TIV, LR-M \[malignancy other than HCC\] or LR-NC
\[non-categorizable\]) and then to a diagnostic table that helps to
distinguish LR-3, LR-4 and LR-5 \[7\]. The classification from LR-1 to
LR-5 is intended as growing probability of HCC malignancy, where LR-1
and LR-2 are considered respectively "certainly benign" and "probably
benign".

5.6 Treatment Response: mRECIST and LI-RADS

Some HCC treatment strategies act by induction of tumor necrosis or
reduction in vascularity, which is not necessarily accompanied by tumor
reduction. The World Health Organization and Response Evaluation
Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria do not address measures of
antitumor activity other than tumor dimensional reduction \[12\]. In
2010, Lencioni et al. proposed a modified version of the RECIST
(mRECIST) for HCC, in which tumor necrosis represents a treatment effect
\[13\]. The mRECIST for HCC has introduced a classification in the
determination of tumor response based on disappearance of tumoral
arterial enhancement and changes in the sum of diameters of target
lesions; it includes complete response, partial response, progressive
disease, stable disease, or not evaluable disease.

5.6.1 LI-RADS Treatment Response Algorithm

The LI-RADS includes a treatment response algorithm that can be applied
to patients with HCC treated by ablation, intra-arterial therapies, or
external beam radiation therapy. The algorithm is based on the visual
assessment of tumor viability defined as nodular, mass-like, or thick,
irregular tissue in or along the treated lesion showing APHE or wash-out
appearance. The LI-RADS algorithm expands on the mRECIST approach not
only by defining viable disease but also by providing nonevaluable,
equivocal, and nonviable treatment response categories. Unlike mRECIST,
the LI-RADS treatment response categories are assigned on a
lesion-by-lesion basis \[7\].

Hepatocellular carcinomaHepatocellular carcinoma
variantsImmunohistochemistryTumor gradePrognostic factors

6.1 Introduction

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a primary malignant tumor of the liver
consisting of neoplastic hepatocytes. Our understanding of this neoplasm
has evolved in recent years and new histological variants and new
molecular alterations have been described. By means of new
immunohistochemical staining it is now possible to evaluate the response
to immunotherapy making the pathologist instrumental in the development
of personalized therapies. HCC can affect any age and both sexes. It
arises in cirrhotic and non-cirrhotic livers, the former being more
frequent. Common risk factors are viral hepatitis C and B, chronic
vascular diseases of the liver, alcohol consumption, non-alcoholic
steatohepatitis, primary hemochromatosis and malignant transformation of
an adenoma. Fibrosis is certainly one of the key factors in the
development of HCC, but numerous other factors are yet unknown. The
discovery of new molecular signatures in HCC, associated with distinct
macroscopic growth patterns, have allowed a molecular classification of
this neoplasm.

6.2 Main Gross Pattern of Hepatocellular Carcinoma

The size of HCC can vary greatly, ranging from a diameter of less than 2
cm to very large tumors with a diameter greater than 20 cm that can
replace an entire lobe of the liver.

There are essentially three main macroscopic patterns: nodular, massive,
and diffuse or cirrhotomimetic. Related to the hepatectomy specimens,
the Liver Cancer Study Group of Japan (LCSGJ) proposed to divide the
nodular type into two subclasses: distinctly nodular and vaguely nodular
\[1\]. The former has been further divided by Shimada et al. into simple
nodular, simple nodular with extranodular growth (Fig. 6.1) and
confluent multi-nodular \[2\].Early/small HCC (E-HCC) is defined as a
hepatocarcinoma ≤2 cm with distinct margins. The concept of small size
emphasizes the diameter of the neoplasm and not an early stage of
hepatocarcinogenesis. Macroscopically, they can be single nodular,
single nodular with extracapsular growth, confluent multinodular and
vaguely nodular \[3\]. Microscopically, E-HCCs are characterized by a
population of well-differentiated neoplastic cells of small or medium
hepatocyte-like size; increase in the density of the nuclei (crowding);
thin trabecules; pseudoglands with or without bile. E-HCCs can contain
poorly differentiated areas that influence the prognosis
(nodule-in-nodule). E-HCCs are potentially invasive malignant neoplasms
that infiltrate the adjacent parenchyma, invade blood vessels, and
metastasize. Compared to the classic HCC they have better
differentiation and the disease-free interval is longer with a low
recurrence rate. Main risk factors for relapses are the absence of a
capsule, vascular microinvasion, and poor cellular differentiation.

Nodular HCC is a well-circumscribed neoplasm of spherical or ovoid
shape, characterized by well-defined margins and expansive growth
pattern. This HCC often arises in the context of a cirrhotic liver and
is often formed by several juxtaposed nodules that can have different
colors from yellowish, reddish, to green (Fig. 6.2). This color
variation may be due to various factors such as bile content, areas of
necrosis and hemorrhages. The texture can range from soft, crumbly, to
firm and depends on the extent of necrosis and on stromal reaction.

Massive HCC causes a marked increase in liver volume that appears to be
mostly replaced by large tumor masses that can occupy an entire lobe. On
cut surface, massive HCC has a soft consistency and variegated
appearance due to the presence of necrosis and hemorrhagic areas.

Diffuse or cirrhotomimetic HCC is characterized by the presence of
numerous nodules, similar to each other in size and shape, which can
reach several hundred and fill the entire liver. Tumor nodules can be
confused with the regenerative nodules of cirrhosis. The presence of
numerous satellites around a dominant nodule is not considered a
cirrhoticomimetic carcinoma.

In addition, there are at least two other variants represented by the
pedunculated type and by the so-called icteric-type HCC.Pedunculated HCC
protrudes from the liver; it is often solitary and can reach a huge
diameter. In relation to the presence of a peduncle (hanging lesions) or
its absence (sessile forms) it is sometimes sub-classified into type I
and type II, respectively. The tumor may also have a long stalk and
appear as a free polypoid mass in the abdominal cavity. Sessile forms
have a dome-shaped appearance and are covered by the liver capsule (Fig.
6.3).

Icteric-type HCC have the tendency to invade the main bile ducts with
occlusion of the lumen and the onset of jaundice. On gross examination
these tumors appear nodular with a tumor mass in the lumen of a dilated
intrahepatic bile duct. Intraductal growth does not seem to have a
different prognosis than other HCCs although the rate of portal venous
invasion is higher.

liver with expanding growth pattern and bile accumulation

the right a lesion that protrudes from the liver surface with a sessile
form is visible (pedunculated HCC, sessile type)

6.3 Histology

The microscopic features of HCC reflect its biological complexity and
change according to differentiation. Two key aspects of the morphology
of these tumors are the absence of portal tracts and the presence of
aberrant arteries. HCC shows architectural changes and cytological
alterations. The main tumor architectural changes consist in a
trabecular, solid or compact, pseudoglandular or acinar, and
macrotrabecular (more than 10 cells thick) pattern (Fig. 6.4). Some HCCs
show a peliotic-like appearance and many HCCs can have mixed
architecture. The tumor stroma is usually not very prominent but cases
with stromal reaction (scirrhous HCC, sclerosing HCC, and fibronodular
HCC) have been recorded. The stromal reaction plays a decisive role in
the growth, spread and even differentiation of the neoplasm. HCCs are
highly vascularized neoplasms and show two patterns of microvessels:
sinusoid-like and capillary-like microvessels \[4\] that affect the
biological behavior of the neoplasm. E-HCC and distinctly nodular HCC
are generally surrounded by a variable thickness fibrous pseudocapsule
(FPC) that can be complete or incomplete. FPC influences the biological
behavior of the neoplasm \[5\].

Fig. 6.4Main histological pattern of hepatocellular carcinoma: (a)
trabecular; (b) solid; (c) macrotrabecular; (d) pseudoglandular

The cytological alterations of neoplastic hepatocytes are as follows:In
well-differentiated HCC they appear very similar to normal hepatocytes,
and in these cases the diagnosis is often based on nuclear crowding and
increase in cytoplasmic basophilia.

In poorly differentiated HCC the cells are characterized by irregular
nuclei, cellular pleomorphism and giant cells with highly atypical
nuclei.

In all HCCs numerous inclusions in the cytoplasm of tumor cells are
frequent. They include eosinophils globules, hyaline globules, pale
bodies and Mallory-Denk bodies (MDBs). Some tumoral hepatocytes can
store glycogen or fat and contain bile, the latter specially in biliary
canaliculi.

6.4 Grading, Staging, and Metastases

An important prognostic factor is tumor grade. It predicts patient
survival and disease-free interval after HCC resection and liver
transplantation. A well-defined, reproducible, and widely accepted
grading system has yet to be developed. From a strictly clinical point
of view, grading based on architectural and cytological features in a
three-tiered system is preferred: well-differentiated, moderately
differentiated and poorly differentiated tumors \[6\], in contrast to
the four-tiered grading system by Edmondson and Steiner \[7\], which is
more appropriate for clinical research.

The main factors in HCC staging are: tumor size, multifocality, tumor
grade and angiolymphatic invasion. Staging is essential to indicate
optimal treatment. The AJCC/UICC (American Joint Committee on
Cancer/Union for International Cancer Control) system is very useful for
predicting the outcome after surgical resection and transplantation.

The most common sites of HCC metastases are the lung, bone, abdominal
lymph nodes and adrenal glands. Peritoneal carcinosis is rare but may be
present. Direct invasion of the diaphragm is also possible.

6.5 Immunohistochemistry

Immunohistochemistry (IHC) has to answer two questions: whether the
lesion of hepatocellular origin is benign or malignant and whether the
neoplasm is an HCC or another malignant tumor. In the non-cirrhotic
liver, if the lesion has a clear hepatocellular differentiation, it is
necessary to evaluate whether it is a focal nodular hyperplasia, an
adenoma or an HCC. In the cirrhotic liver one must differentiate between
a macroregenerative nodule, a dysplastic nodule (low or high grade) and
HCC. The following immunostains are commonly used for major
differentiation diagnosis: glypican-3, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), HepPar1,
arginase-1, polyclonal CEA and CD10 (both canalicular pattern).

6.6 Variants

Several histological subtypes of HCC have been recognized. The subtypes
or variants of HCC have a distinct histological morphology, distinct
immunohistochemical and molecular markers, a different clinical
correlation and a different prognosis \[8\].

Combined hepatocellular carcinoma-cholangiocarcinoma (cHCC-CCA) is a
distinct molecular lesion that can originate in cirrhotic and
non-cirrhotic livers and its frequency is estimated at around 2--5% of
primary liver tumors. Prognosis is intermediate between HCC and CCA,
lymph node metastases are frequent and it has higher risk of recurrence
after surgical resection and higher risk of relapse after orthotopic
liver transplantation (OLT). A neuroendocrine component in HCC or CCA is
very rare. These tumors belong to the group of mixed
neuroendocrine-non-neuroendocrine tumors (MiNENs). In clear-cell HCC we
have more than 50% of clear cells. The prognosis is better than
non-clear HCCs and the main differential diagnosis is with renal cell
carcinoma metastases and other clear-cell tumors.

Other peculiar variants of HCC are granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor
producing HCC, lymphocyte-rich HCC, scirrhous HCC, and steatohepatitic
HCC. The latter subtype often arises in the context of steatohepatitis
and shows macrovesicular steatosis, ballooned cells, Mallory-Denk
bodies, intratumoral inflammation and fibrosis. The amount of fat needed
to qualify a steatohepatitic HCC must be greater than 33%. There seems
to be no difference in survival from ordinary HCC.

Fibrolamellar HCC is a distinct subtype that arises in young patients
without cirrhosis and no underlying liver disease, with distinct
clinical features, as well as unique morphologic, immunohistochemical,
and molecular findings. After surgical resection, approximately 55% of
cases has intrahepatic recurrence within the first 5 years.
Macroscopically, it is a voluminous neoplasm with central scar and
calcifications. The neoplastic cells are polygonal, eosinophilic, with
macronucleoli, immersed in an abundant collagen stroma with a lamellar
appearance. Pale bodies are frequent but not specific. These tumors are
HepPar1+ and arginase 1+. Eosinophilic granular cytoplasm is CD68
positive and tumor cells express CK7 and CK19. The DNAJB1-PRKACA fusion
gene is considered to be pathognomonic \[9\].

A recently described subtype of HCC is termed macrotrabecular/massive
HCC (MTM-HCC). MTM-HCC is characterized by large trabeculae with a
thickness greater than 10 cells affecting at least 50% of an HCC. It
frequently originates in non-cirrhotic livers and it is often associated
with high levels of AFP. These tumors are large in size and have
frequent angioinvasion with poor prognosis.

Other variants are: chromophobe HCC, fibronodular HCC, and myxoid HCC.

6.7 Differential Diagnosis

The main differential diagnosis of HCC is with benign and malignant
neoplasms in cirrhotic and non-cirrhotic livers. In the latter the
differential diagnosis is made with focal nodular hyperplasia and
adenoma, while in cirrhotic livers with macroregenerative nodules and
with low- and high-grade dysplastic nodules. The most suggestive aspects
for the diagnosis of HCC are stromal invasion and sinusoid
arterialization, well highlighted with immunostain for CD34. The use of
a panel of IHC markers (glypican 3, glutamine-synthetase, and HSP70) can
help in the differential diagnosis between benign and malignant nodules.
A clear positivity of at least two out of three markers strongly
supports HCC.

7.1 Introduction

Most patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have underlying liver
disease \[1\]. The need to predict the risk of post-hepatectomy liver
failure (PHLF) should be of greater interest before performing a liver
resection in a cirrhotic patient, especially if the indication is
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), which can be treated with other options,
including liver transplantation, thermoablation or effective palliative
techniques, such as chemoembolization or radioembolization.

The task of the hepatologist, in supporting the surgical team, is to
help in identifying the cirrhotic patient at greater risk of clinical
decompensation of portal hypertension, up to the fearful development of
postsurgical liver failure. In this chapter, we explain how the
evaluation must go beyond the simple measurement of the well-known
parameters of liver function. Over the past decade there has been
substantial progress in hepatic resection for hepatocarcinoma (HCC)
\[2\], which can be explained by a better selection of surgical
candidates and improvement of pre- and postoperative management \[3\].
Nevertheless, liver failure after major resection in cirrhosis is still
associated with high morbidity and mortality \[4\], and the fear of such
complications therefore continues to limit the therapeutic possibilities
of hepatic resection in patients with HCC. Liver surgery for
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains limited by two major aspects: a
sufficient remnant of liver volume must be preserved \[5\] and, second,
ischemic injury to remnant liver cells should be reduced as much as
possible to minimize reperfusion injury. The threshold below which the
liver remnant becomes insufficient depends on different variables, the
most commonly proposed being age, etiologies of liver disease, grade of
hepatic disease and portal hypertension, and hepatic functional reserve
\[6\].

Age alone does not contraindicate liver resection. In previous studies
on liver resection for HCC, the age of 70 years was reported as one of
the negative predictive factors for postoperative survival. The most
recent literature has, however, refuted this result and to date a
careful selection of the elderly patient allows one to obtain survivals
similar to those of younger patients \[6\].

7.1.1 Etiologies of Liver Disease: Metabolic-Associated Fatty Liver
Disease

Among the different etiologies of liver disease, particular
consideration in patients evaluated for liver resection should be given
to hepatic steatosis, a constantly increasing cause of liver disease.
Growing attention is being paid to advanced steatosis as it seems to
compromise or delay liver regeneration after major resection. The risk
of resection begins to increase in the case of steatosis involving more
than 30% of hepatocytes \[7\]. Experimental data indicate that
macro-type steatosis, rather than micro-steatosis, increases surgical
risk. In cases of steatosis involving 30--60% of hepatocytes, larger
resections should be carefully evaluated. In cases of steatosis \>60% of
hepatocytes, the resections should be limited (\<2 hepatic segments and
preferably an enucleation is advisable) \[8\].

In the case of a suspicion of advanced steatosis, it is recommended to
perform a liver biopsy to exclude a critical burden of steatosis and
eventually plan a preoperative medical treatment. The suspicion of
hepatic steatosis should go beyond the simple external evaluation of
body mass index or composition or the presence of diabetes, as
demonstrated in a seminal study on liver resection in
metabolic-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD), where 31.9% of
patients with hepatic steatosis did not show any signs of metabolic
syndrome nor a history of alcohol abuse and were not treated with
steatogenic chemotherapy (i.e., irinotecan) before liver resection
\[7\].

In these patients, histological evaluation allows to assess the presence
of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and the degree of fibrosis.
Reddy et al. found that patients with NASH had higher 90-day overall
mortality (56.9% vs. 37.3%; p = 0.008) and any hepatic-related morbidity
(28.4% vs. 15.7%; p = 0.043), compared with corresponding controls. This
includes a higher rate of postoperative hepatic decompensation (16.7%
vs. 6.9%; p = 0.049) and a higher risk of post-hepatectomy liver
insufficiency (6.9% vs. 2.0%; p = 0.170). On multivariable logistic
regression, resection of four or more segments (OR 9.4; 95% CI:
4.1--21.5; p \< 0.001), and NASH (OR 2.7; 95% CI: 1.0--6.1; p = 0.016)
were independently associated with any hepatic-related morbidity. Hence
liver inflammation is the key feature to include among the negative
predictive factors of liver resection outcome in patients with MAFLD
\[7\]. A more recent study performed in an Asian cohort of patients also
found that liver failure of all grades was higher in the MAFLD group
compared with other etiologies (29.5% vs. 9.5% moderate liver failure,
and 20.1% vs. 7.2% severe liver failure; p \< 0.0001). Extrahepatic
complications, such as cardiac disease (11.8% vs. 6.8%; p = 0.02) and
pulmonary embolism (2% vs. 0.4%; p = 0.01) were also higher in the MAFLD
group compared with other etiologies \[9\]. A drawback of these studies
is the absence of a clear distinction between MAFLD and NASH.

7.2 Methods to Evaluate Liver Function and Hepatic Reserve Before
Surgery

The safety of resective liver surgery in patients with cirrhosis has
significantly improved in the last decade, but mortality related to
surgery is still estimated between 3% and 15% \[3\]. Post-hepatectomy
liver failure (PHLF) is the most feared complication, with a mortality
rate of up to 50%. In this chapter, for the definition of PHLF we
adopted the classification given by the International Study Group of
Liver Surgery in 2011. According to this definition, the parameters to
define the three grades (A, B, C) of PHLF are based on hepatic
(INR/neurologic symptoms), renal (acute kidney injury criteria) and
pulmonary function (arterial oxygen saturation) \[10\]. For convenience,
we will use the definition of "mild" (INR between 1.5 and 2 + grade
I--II of hepatic encephalopathy) or "severe" (INR \> 2 + grade III--IV
hepatic encephalopathy) to mean those PHLF in which there was a
deviation from the regular clinical management without or with invasive
treatment, respectively.

7.2.1 Predictors of Post-hepatectomy Liver Failure

Invasive portal pressure measurement is one of the most important and
more concordantly evaluated indicators of outcome. Moreover, a hepatic
venous pressure gradient (HVPG) \>6 mmHg indicates the presence of
cirrhosis more accurately than liver histology \[11\]. Also in the case
of compensated cirrhosis without esophageal varices, a further
stratification is warranted, based on the measurement of portal
pressure, which is most commonly assessed by the invasive (transjugular)
measurement of HVPG, consisting of the difference between the wedged (or
balloon-occluded) hepatic venous pressure and the free hepatic venous
pressure. The HVPG accurately reflects portal pressure in sinusoidal
causes of portal hypertension \[12\]. Although it is fairly easy to
perform and safe, accurate measurement requires specific training
\[13\]. For this reason, the number of studies conducted to assess the
role of the HVPG as a prognostic factor are also limited in number,
although the conclusions are fairly solid and concordant \[14, 15\]. The
stratification of compensated cirrhosis has also been based on the HVPG
results, with HVPG between 5 and 10 mmHg indicating mild portal
hypertension and above 10 mmHg indicating a clinically significant
portal hypertension (CSPH) at risk of ascites, encephalopathy, jaundice
and varices \[12\].

The first reports on HVPG assessment before liver resection were
published in 1996 and 1999 by the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer group
and included a small series of patients applying for hepatic resection
(29 and 43 patients, respectively) \[12\]. Based on these two studies,
the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) and American
Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) recommended in their
guidelines the use of HVPG in the selection of hepatic resection
candidates (indicating HVPG \< 10 mmHg and normal bilirubin as key
positive predictors of survival in patients undergoing resection). More
recently, a French multicenter study on more than 300 patients confirmed
that among the 20 patients with PHLF, HVPG was a strong independent
predictor of worse outcome. PHLF was 8.3 vs. 50% (p = 0.001) if HVPG was
below or above 10 mmHg, respectively. However, the latest published EASL
HCC guidelines mitigate the role of HVPG \> 10 mmHg as a
contraindication to surgery, and suggest that the role of portal
hypertension in deciding on eligibility for resection of HCC should not
be absolute but always balanced with the extent of hepatectomy and liver
function indicators \[16\]. We also believe that resection decisions
must also be taken on the basis of the localization of the hepatic
nodule; for instance, the posterior sectors are burdened with greater
technical difficulties \[17\]. The predictive value of HVPG is further
enhanced when combined with the MELD score, using for the latter the
value of 10 as a cut-off. In patients with HVPG ≥ 10 mmHg but with a
MELD score \<10, severe PHLF occurred in 14.3% of cases when an
enucleation was performed, whereas this percentage increased up to 66.7%
in cases of more extended hepatectomies (more than 2 segments).

In patients with an HVPG \> 10 mmHg and MELD ≥10, severe PHLF occurred
in 87.5%, even in the case of limited resections. Less than 20% of the
patients enrolled experienced a normal and uneventful postoperative
course in spite of having a pressure gradient ≥10 mmHg \[13\].
Therefore, the most appropriate approach to avoid excluding patients who
might otherwise benefit from a curative HCC resection, or who might
otherwise take too high a surgical risk, is to use a multiparametric
algorithm as the one recently proposed by Citterio et al. and then
endorsed by EASL \[18\]. According to this hierarchical interaction
(portal pressure + extent of resection + MELD score), HVPG \> 10 mmHg or
indirect evidence of CSPH are no longer an absolute contraindication for
HCC resection in patients with cirrhosis, if MELD is below 10 and the
resection limited. Other studies which included patients with HVPG \> 10
mmHg found an acceptable risk of PHLF of about 5--30%, with an
acceptable 36-month survival (about 75%) \[19\]. In the case of HVPG \>
10 mmHg, we should select those with a good performance status (PS
0--1), with preserved liver function (MELD \<10), and without any sign
of clinical decompensation of liver cirrhosis (only Child A5--6),
including the absence of esophageal varices.

7.2.2 Biomarkers and Dynamic Test to Recognize Liver Function and Its
Reserve Capacity

Among the various biomarkers used to investigate liver function,
certainly the most validated are bilirubin values preresection and
coagulation status. The use of hepatic clearance of indocyanine green
(ICG) has been widely used in Asian countries for surgical decision
making. ICG is a dark bluish-green tricarbocyanine dye that rapidly
binds to plasma lipoprotein and is metabolized completely and solely by
hepatocytes. ICG clearance can be measured by giving a single
intravenous injection (around 0.5 mg/kg) and determining the blood level
15 min later (ICG-R15) \[14\]. The normal values of the ICG-R15 range
between 8% and 14%. Patients with clearance kinetics of less than 14%
are considered fit for major hepatectomy, whereas those with \>20%, a
major hepatectomy should be not recommended. According to some authors,
in patients with a retention between 14% and 20%, surgery should be
proposed only if the liver remnant is \>50% \[5\]. ICG can be measured
directly by using a fingertip optical sensor, which allows a continuous
measurement of serum ICG concentration \[12\]. Much of the experience of
using ICG before surgery comes from studies conducted on Asian patients,
with a high prevalence of early HBV-related cirrhosis. Makuuchi et al.
in a seminal study conducted on a large sample of Asian patients
proposed an algorithm based on ICG-R15, ascites, bilirubin levels and
the extent of liver resection \[20\]. However, in a recent French
multicenter study on 343 patients, applying the Imamura and Makuuchi
criteria, as many as 13 patients would not have been candidate for
resection surgery due to a high estimated risk of PHLF, while in the
French experience 92% of them were alive at the surveillance after 3
months \[15\].

7.2.3 MELD Score

Another algorithm to assess the operational risk, elaborated with the
intention of having a quick and simple evaluation tool, is based on the
use of MELD \<10, associated with natremia for those with MELD 9--10. In
an external validation, also this algorithm failed its reproducibility.

7.2.4 Fibrosis Biomarkers and Noninvasive Evaluation of Portal
Hypertension

With regard to fibrosis biomarkers, no study conducted so far has shown
a correlation between their serum levels and the development of
clinically significant portal hypertension. Platelet counts also have
less than 0.75 accuracy at the AUROC (area under the receiver operating
characteristic) curve.

On the other hand, noninvasive tests are increasingly being used to
improve prediction of CSPH. Liver stiffness measurement (LSM) is the
most validated test for indirect portal pressure measurement, although
its correlation with HVPG is not excellent (AUROC 0.67--0.86) \[21\].
Our advice is to use, in order to assess patients at risk of HVPG \> 10
mmHg a cut-off of LSM equal to 20--25 kPa (AUROC 0.93 for CSPH) \[22\].
Spleen elastometry (SEM) has been tested in a more limited number of
studies, but a cut-off \<40 kPa is highly sensitive (98%) to rule out
HVPG \> 10 mmHg, while SEM \> 50 kPa is 90% specific for CSPH. The liver
surface nodularity (LSN) score performed at CT or ultrasound \[23\]
predicts HVPG \> 10 mmHg in 88%. While the diameter of the spleen as
well as that of the portal vein have a lower accuracy. A recent portal
hypertension score has been proposed to combine LSM and LSN to improve
the detection reliability for CSPH to more than 75% \[24\].

7.3 Conclusion

In accordance with the recent EASL guidelines on noninvasive liver
disease severity and prognosis evaluation methods, we believe that HVPG
remains the only validated tool for an exact assessment of portal
hypertension severity and cannot be substituted by noninvasive
techniques \[25\].

In conclusion, none of the proposed algorithms based on biomarkers of
liver function has entered routine surgical practice. Clinicians and
surgeons engaged in resective liver surgery know that portal
hypertension is the most important prognostic factor associated with
PHLF. In consideration of the logistic difficulty to perform invasive
portal pressure measurement on all surgical candidates, our idea is to
first study patients with noninvasive methods and to refer to a center
with a hepatic hemodynamics team those at high risk of clinically
significant portal hypertension. Liver function should obviously not be
neglected but integrated in a multiparametric consideration, bearing in
mind that in patients with bilirubin between 27 and 33 mmol/L or MELD
scores about 10 and portal hypertension, surgical consideration should
not be denied a priori. A short delay of surgical resection, allowing
better clinical management, is recommendable in these cases.

Hepatocellular carcinomaPercutaneous approachLaparoscopic
approachThermoablationRadiofrequency ablationMicrowave ablation

8.1 Introduction

Over the last few decades, percutaneous and laparoscopic ablative
techniques have grown as a potentially curative therapeutic option for
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Ablation refers to necrosis achieved
using chemicals or thermal energy delivered directly to the tumor under
image guidance. The seminal technique was percutaneous ethanol injection
(PEI). Subsequently, hyper-thermal ablative therapies emerged, including
radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and microwave ablation (MWA). Ablation is
now considered a valid complement to surgery or even a replacement for
resection. It enables sparing of parenchyma, alone or in combination
with surgery, and allows treatment of high-risk patients.

8.2 Treatment Indications

Beside thermal ablation, potentially curative therapies for HCC include
liver resection (LR) and liver transplantation (LT). Owing to the
absence of randomized trials comparing the three approaches, when
selecting the best option, it is recommended to evaluate the main
independent clinical prognostic factors of HCC: tumor burden, vascular
invasion, extrahepatic spread, liver function, portal hypertension, and
patient conditions (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group \[ECOG\]
Performance Status) \[1\]. Both the European Association for the Study
of the Liver and the American Association for the Study of Liver
Diseases have endorsed the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) staging
system that incorporates all the above-mentioned items \[1, 2\].

Currently, thermal ablation may be considered as first-line therapy in
very early-stage HCC (BCLC 0: single tumor \<2 cm, no vascular
invasion/satellites, preserved liver function, ECOG-0) and is the best
option for patients with early-stage HCC (BCLC A: single tumor \>2 cm or
three nodules \<3 cm, preserved liver function, ECOG-0) who are not
candidates for LR. In selected cases, LR leads to the best outcomes
(5-year survival of 60--80%) and represents the treatment of choice for
patients without cirrhosis, but LR in the cirrhotic liver should be
reserved only for patients with solitary tumors, very well-preserved
liver function, no portal hypertension or platelet count ≥100,000/mL
\[3\]. Even though an extension of these criteria could be considered,
especially after the promising results obtained in experienced centers
with LR in patients who did not satisfy the requirements, a consensus
has not been reached yet \[4\]. To address the issue of patients with
small tumors and impaired liver function, with respect to the
therapeutic hierarchy strategy, ablation can be considered the best
option for patients affected by both unresectable BCLC A and B HCC
\[5\].

Ablation therapy may serve to treat LT candidates within the Milan
criteria to reduce the drop-out risk due to tumor progression while
waiting (bridging) or to bring patients within validated criteria for LT
(downstaging) \[6\]. Indeed, response to bridging and downstaging
treatments affects the rate of post-LT tumor recurrence \[7\].

8.3 Ablation Techniques

"Percutaneous" refers to any procedure that delivers chemicals or energy
by a guided puncture of the tumor through the abdominal wall of the
patient under local anesthesia.

PEI was one of the initial ablative techniques employed for treatment of
HCC. Ethanol (95--99.5%) induces coagulative necrosis of the nodule
because of cellular dehydration, protein denaturation, and chemical
occlusion of small tumor vessels. PEI is performed under ultrasound (US)
guidance or in combination with computed tomography (CT). A needle is
advanced inside the target lesion and 5--10 mL of agent is injected
(several times for tumors \>2 cm). PEI is fast and cheaper compared to
other techniques \[8\], but it is characterized by insufficient control
of ethanol spread, inhomogeneous distribution within the lesions, and
inadequate margin treatment due to heterogeneity within the tumor
architecture. Almost complete necrosis can be achieved in HCC ≤ 2 cm
treated with PEI \[9\], but for larger nodules local recurrence is
common \[10\], particularly if compared to thermal ablation techniques.

Heat producing coagulative necrosis of hepatocytes is the mechanism
behind RFA and MWA.

RFA produces heat by using high frequency alternating current passed
through a circuit including a generator, a monopolar electrode needle
advanced into the target lesion, dispersive grounding plates located on
the patient's skin, and the tumor, the resistive element. The applied
current agitates ions around the tip of the electrode and heat is then
conducted deeper into the surrounding tissue. Irreversible cell injury
depends on the duration of heat application: the shorter the application
the higher the temperatures required \[11\]. Evidence suggests immediate
cell death at temperatures of 60--100 °C or within 5--6 min of heat
application \>50 °C \[12\]. Heat allows extension of the necrosis to a
safety ring in the peri-tumoral tissue, which might eliminate undetected
satellites and might explain the fewer local recurrence compared to PEI.
RFA offers increased control over the ablation zone shape, but this is
also impacted by increased tissue impedance, which occurs with tissue
desiccation and vaporization \[11\]. This issue has been overcome with
the advent of MWA.

Microwaves are generated by applicators in a range between 915 MHz and
2.45 GHz and transmitted by an antenna to polar water molecules,
resulting in tissue heating. They penetrate through biologic materials
with high impedance, such as dehydrated or charred tissue. In other
terms, MWA can deliver high temperatures for longer time, thus improving
ablation efficacy by increasing thermal conduction into the surrounding
tissue \[11\] and allowing faster treatments of larger tumors compared
to RFA \[13\].

The efficacy of percutaneous ablation depends on the imaging-guidance
tools, given that precise tumor targeting is essential for achieving
complete necrosis. Currently, US, computed tomography (CT), and
cone-beam CT are the modalities of choice for guidance and result
assessment. Fusion imaging is a novel technique that enables the overlay
of multiple imaging and is helpful in small tumors to decrease the risk
of missing the target \[14\].

Hyperthermal ablation techniques have drawbacks. Heat applied near large
vessels, typically the hepatic veins, undergoes thermodynamic exchange
with the blood stream and ablation efficacy is diminished. MWA is less
susceptible to this phenomenon (heat sink effect) than RFA \[15\]. Both
RFA and MWA share similar complications including hemorrhage, hepatic
abscess, pneumothorax, bowel perforation, biliary injury, and track
seeding. Slow retraction of the electrode/antenna (track ablation) is a
technical refinement that may reduce hemorrhage and seeding. In any
case, major complication rates are 2--10% and the procedure-related
mortality rates are \<1% \[16\].

There are several other percutaneous thermal ablation modalities under
investigation, such as laser ablation, cryoablation and irreversible
electroporation. Results are promising, but these techniques require
higher operator skills and are burdened by severe complications.
Therefore, their use is not currently recommended in the routine
treatment of HCC, but only as part of clinical trials.

Even though less invasive procedures are preferable in cirrhotic HCC
patients, the percutaneous approach has major limitations.
Thrombocytopenia and portal hypertension expose patients to an
unacceptable risk of peri-operative bleeding. Indirect localization of
the tumor requires operator expertise and confidence with image-guidance
tools. Moreover, target lesions are often in high-risk locations or too
deep to be safely reached from the skin surface. Therefore, to increase
the number of patients who could benefit from ablative treatment,
laparoscopic ablation has been implemented for RFA and MWA assisted by
laparoscopic intraoperative ultrasound (LUS) (Fig. 8.1).

Fig. 8.1Laparoscopic microwave ablation (Prof. Cillo's personal
experience)

Criteria reaching the highest consensus for a laparoscopic approach are:
HCC not visible percutaneously (along the diaphragm) or next to the
hilum (risk of biliary thermal injuries), HCC near visceral structures,
ineligibility for LR and severe coagulopathy \[17--19\].

LUS is a major advantage compared to the percutaneous approach since it
is considered the most effective tool for detecting liver nodules
\[18\]. Clinical experience supports a single-stage approach with
immediate ablation of newly discovered HCC \[18, 20\].

Laparoscopy allows direct visualization of the liver, enhancing the
ability to treat HCC located at the dome, peripherally, or in proximity
to other organs. In the latter scenario, laparoscopy permits active
protection of surrounding structures, reducing the risk of visceral
injuries. Moreover, visualization of the entry point of the applicator
allows bleeding source control. Severe complications rates are reported
to be about 2% \[17\]. Common complications are pneumonia, pneumothorax,
and bleeding from the trocar access. Tumor seeding, peritoneal
dissemination, biliary strictures, arterial thrombosis, and liver
abscess are reported less frequently.

While remaining minimally invasive, laparoscopic ablation is more
flexible compared to the percutaneous approach \[18, 19, 21\] and, for
HCC in difficult locations, it improves success rates \[18, 19\].

8.4 Oncological Outcomes

Although PEI has been largely replaced by thermoablation, it may still
be applied in selected cases or to target part of a tumor located near
structures at risk for thermal injury. Metanalyses comparing PEI to RFA
have demonstrated the superiority of the latter in terms of overall
survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS). The 3-year survival
rate of patients treated with PEI was 48--67%, while for those treated
with RFA it was 63--81%. Local tumor recurrence (LTR) was significantly
less frequent with RFA \[8, 22\].

In the absence of randomized trials comparing RFA to surgery in
compensated cirrhotic patients with very early HCC, Cho et al. created a
Markov model to simulate a randomized trial comparing LR, percutaneous
RFA monotherapy and percutaneous RFA monotherapy followed by LR in the
case of local residual disease. The expected values for OS were 7.6,
7.4, and 7.6 years, respectively, while the expected 5-year OS rates
were 62.5%, 60.3%, and 62.3% \[23\]. For unresectable candidates, the
combination of RFA and transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) has shown
benefit in terms of OS and RFS compared to monotherapy with RFA (OS: HR
= 0.62; 95% CI 0.49--0.78, p \< 0.001; RFS: HR = 0.55; 95% CI
0.40--0.76, p \< 0.001) or TACE alone (2-year OS: 91.1% vs. 60.6%, p =
0.004; 2-year LTR: 48.1% vs. 78.2%, p \< 0.001) \[24, 25\]. In cases of
single HCC \< 3 cm, when tumor recurs after RFA, LT should be considered
\[26\].

As for MWA vs. RFA, Cui et al. have recently found no significant
difference in 3- and 5-year OS, in 3-year RFS, in 1-year LTR, in
technical efficacy, or in major complications. MWA is compared to LR
only in two non-randomized studies showing similar 3-year OS (MWA
70--87.7% vs. LR 72--93.6%), but higher LTR (MWA 10.3--16.2% vs. LR
2.8--4.9%) \[27\].

Laparoscopic ablation achieves total necrosis of the tumor in a single
session in more than 90% of the cases, comparable with the expected
range of success of percutaneous ablation. Local tumor progression, when
looking at the experience gained in the era of laparoscopy, is 2.8--23%
\[17\]. In the earliest years, median OS for patients undergoing
laparoscopic RFA for unresectable HCC was 26 months, while RFS was 14
months \[28\]. More recent analyses in high-volume centers, offering
laparoscopic ablation for HCC unsuitable for LR or LT, report 1-, 3-,
and 5-year OS of 88%, 55%, and 34%, respectively \[18\]. A retrospective
analysis of 815 laparoscopic MWA on 674 patients treated in the authors'
center, one of the most experienced in this field, has reported 1-, 3-,
and 5-year OS of 81.9%, 54.9%, and 35.9%, respectively \[19\]. The
updated data are listed in Table 8.1.Table 8.1Laparoscopic microwave

Hepatocellular carcinomaTransarterial chemoembolizationTransarterial
radioembolizationSelective internal radiation therapyDosimetry

9.1 Introduction

Hepatic tumors, in particular hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), present an
almost exclusive arterial supply as opposed to the normal parenchyma,
which is vascularized by the portal vein. The neo-angiogenesis creates
the possibility of releasing high quantities of drugs or radiation
directly into the tumor, minimizing systemic effects.

9.2 Transarterial Chemoembolization

Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is an interventional radiology
procedure consisting of the concomitant administration, via a
transarterial route, of embolic material and anti-cancer drugs into the
liver \[1\].

The indications for TACE in HCC encompass, according to the Barcelona
Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) group, patients with intermediate stage (BCLC
stage B) with a class of recommendation IA \[2\] and, more recently,
with very early and early stage (BCLC stage 0 and A) with a class of
recommendation of IB \[2\].

9.2.1 Technical Variations

From a technical point of view, the TACE technique presents several
variations according to embolic material and drugs.

Concerning embolic material, it is possible to distinguish conventional
TACE (c-TACE), drug-eluting microsphere TACE (DEM-TACE) and degradable
starch microsphere TACE (DSM-TACE).

c-TACE uses ethyl ester of iodized fatty acids of poppy seed oil
(Lipiodol, Guerbet, France) as embolic material, mixed with anticancer
drugs \[1\]. This emulsion is injected selectively into the arterial
feeder of the HCC followed by a gelfoam solution for ensuring complete
embolization \[1\]. c-TACE has the most consistent body of evidence
regarding clinical results. Two randomized controlled trials (RCTs)
showed that the c-TACE group had a relative risk of death ranging from
0.47 (95% CI 0.25--0.91) to 0.49 (95% CI 0.29--0.81) with a better
overall survival compared with the control group \[3, 4\].

DEM-TACE uses microspheres as delivery and embolic material \[1\]. These
microspheres allow slow release of the anti-cancer drugs used. The
linkage between the beads and the drugs is based on ionic interaction.
There are several different types of bead based on size and intrinsic
opacity. The guidelines recommend a standard size of 100--300 μm. Two
RCTs tried to demonstrate the superiority of DEM-TACE vs. c-TACE with
poor results \[5, 6\]. In particular, the authors found no oncological
benefit, but a better safety profile and drug-eluting toxicity. However,
this evidence dates back to the early 2010s. More recently, Yang et al.
\[7\], in a systematic review in 2020, showed a better 2-year overall
survival of DEM-TACE vs. c-TACE (relative risk 0.89; 95% CI 0.81--0.99;
p = 0.046).

DSM-TACE uses a resorbable amylomer (hydrolyzed potato starch) shaped as
beads of 45 ± 7 μm in size that can be mixed with different anti-cancer
drugs. The beads are enzymatically degraded by amylases, they have a
half-life of about 35--50 min and are completely resorbed after
approximately 2 h \[8\]. Very few reports exist on the value of DSM-TACE
in HCC treatment. In particular, DSM-TACE was tested as first- and
second-line (after kinase inhibitors discharge) treatment with promising
results \[8, 9\]. One report by Auer et al. \[10\] showed comparable
results between DSM-TACE and transarterial radioembolization.

The most used drug, in the USA and Europe, is doxorubicin. A few new
drugs have been tested against doxorubicin in TACE. Shi et al. \[11\],
in a RCT, showed that a mix of lobaplatin, epirubicin and mitomycin C
has a better overall survival compared with doxorubicin alone. However,
two RCTs failed to demonstrate the superiority of epirubicin over
doxorubicin \[12, 13\].

9.3 Transarterial Radioembolization

Transarterial radioembolization (TARE) is based on the transarterial
hepatic delivery of a radioisotope, yttrium 90 (90Y), a pure
beta-radiation emitter \[14\]. 90Y is loaded onto microspheres; resin
for Sirtex (SIR-Sphere, Sirtex Medical, Australia) and glass for
Therasphere (TheraSphere, Boston Scientific, Marlborough, MA, USA), with
differences between the two devices \[14\]. Both devices present
potential benefits.

9.3.1 Technical Considerations

All patients must undergo careful pre-treatment angiographic mapping of
the vascularization of the tumors less than 2 weeks before the
procedure; 185 MBq of 99mTc-macroaggregated albumin allows single-photon
emission computed tomography (SPECT) scanning assessment of pulmonary or
digestive shunting. A lung shunt \>20% or 30 Gy potentially
contraindicates the treatment \[14\]. The careful search for and
embolization of all the suspected vessels for digestive shunting is
mandatory to avoid the possibly severe consequences of non-target
embolization and can be done in the same treatment session \[14\]. This
phase must possibly include preliminary cone-beam CT to ensure correct
and safe delivery of the radio-device. Assessment of the treatment can
be done by SPECT (bremsstrahlung photons) or positron emission
tomography (PET) (Fig. 9.1). Recently, the possibility of same-day
angiography assessment and treatment has been explored with good
results.

carcinoma (HCC) at segments 5/7 and previous surgical segmentectomy of
segment 6. The patient underwent transarterial radioembolization (TARE)

SIRTEX) as a bridge to surgery (right lobectomy). (b) Pre-TARE planning

6 and 17 months showing the complete ablation of the HCC and (f)
hypertrophy of the left lobe with no need for surgery. At 3 years,
imaging still shows sustained response, without relapse

9.3.2 Lessons Learned

Careful patient selection has shown to be essential in treating HCC
patients with TARE. The expected patient response to TARE correlates
with liver function, albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) score, tumor burden,
performance status, and the presence of extra-hepatic disease \[15\].
The ALBI score \[16\] seems to surpass the Child-Pugh score in selecting
patients, albumin acting as a prognostic biomarker. The extent of portal
vein thrombosis, when present, can also play a prognostic role \[17\].

Scintigraphy pre-assessment allows quantification of dosimetry with
multi-compartmental or voxel dosimetry. The procedure and the doses need
to be accurately tailored to the tumor burden, the vascularization, and
the therapeutic purpose.

The selection of centers with multidisciplinary groups, reproducible and
standardized techniques, and adequate technology with cone-beam CT are
the fundamental factors of good practice.

9.3.3 Indications and Clinical Utility

Historically, TARE has been used in the advanced setting demonstrating
good results in particular with portal thrombosis (BCLC stage B/C). The
multicentric European analysis ENRY 4 provided robust evidence on tumor
responses and high disease control rates with a safe profile all across
BCLC stages. However, the three phase III trials, SARAH and SIRveNIB
(TARE vs. sorafenib) and SORAMIC (TARE + sorafenib vs. sorafenib),
conducted in advanced HCC patients failed to show any benefit in overall
survival \[18--20\]. They also confirmed the non-inferiority of TARE and
the clear benefits in terms of reduced toxicity (fewer adverse events)
and improved quality of life compared to sorafenib \[21\]. The limits of
these trials have been well analyzed: center selection and skills,
patient selection, delay of treatment, and low dosimetry \[21\].
Consequently, TARE was not included in the 2018 guidelines of the
European and American Associations for the Study of the Liver (EASL,
AASLD) \[22\].

In the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) guidelines \[2\],
the indications for TARE moved from the advanced stage on to the early
and intermediate stage, but with only a moderate level of evidence. In
fact, the concept of ablative setting, radiation segmentectomy or
lobectomy, strictly correlated to dosimetry, has emerged more recently
with outcomes at 5 years as good as other curative methods, surgery or
ablation \[23, 24\]. The focus on dosimetry of the latest trials
DOSISPHERE and LEGACY also clearly showed good results \[24, 25\].

This has allowed TARE to enter the BCLC stage 0--A, competing with other
curative treatments \[2\].

Despite the fact that there were no more indications in the advanced
stage in guidelines, due to the recent development of new systemic
therapies, the latest ESMO update of 2021 \[2\] reintroduced TARE in the
advanced setting for patients with liver-confined disease not suitable
for TACE and/or systemic therapy.

It should also be underlined the ability of TARE to compete with portal
embolization, inducing hypertrophy of the future remnant liver after
lobar radioembolization, on a slower timescale than through portal
embolization, but with the additional value of local disease control
\[26\] and downstaging for surgery.

9.3.4 Downstaging

The downstaging strategy relies on evidence that a baseline low-risk
patient has the same probability of recurrence than a high-risk patient
who is reassigned, after locoregional therapy, to low risk \[27\]. No
guidelines exist on the upper limits for downstaging inclusion; however,
a general consensus defines the limits as: one lesion \>5 cm and ≤8 cm;
two to three lesions each ≤5 cm; or four to five lesions each ≤3 cm with
total tumor diameter ≤8 cm \[28\].

In a meta-analysis, Parikh et al. \[29\] reported a successful
downstaging rate of 48% (95% CI 39--58%) without differences between
TACE and TARE. Gabr et al. \[30\] showed that TACE and TARE groups have
the same outcome after orthotopic liver transplantation (months to
recurrence: 26.6 (95% CI 7.0--49.5) vs. 15.9 months (95% CI 7.8--46.8),
respectively; p = 0.48). In addition, in one RCT, Mazzaferro et al.
\[31\], demonstrated that, regardless of downstaging methods
(locoregional, surgical or systemic), orthotopic liver transplantation
improved event-free survival rate vs. the control group (76.8% \[95% CI
60.8--96.9\] vs. 18.3% \[95% CI 7.1--47.0\]). These data seem to suggest
that there are no differences between the downstaging strategies.
However, several issues must be clarified. First, the choice of which
locoregional treatment should be used depends on the patient/disease
characteristics, namely BCLC is applied for each patient. For example,
TACE patients have on average a lower disease stage compared to TARE
patients. Second, the downstaging strategy generally has a
multidisciplinary and multimodality approach by including ablation,
surgery, trans-catheter, and systemic treatment. However, a RCT
comparing the downstaging results of each single modality is unfeasible
due to ethical issues.

9.3.5 Bridging

Bridging consists of reducing the drop-out from the active transplant
list. The existing 2018 guidelines (AASLD, EASL) \[22\] suggest bridging
to liver transplantation (OLT) within the Milan criteria with the aim of
limiting the drop-out and the recurrences post OLT, with low evidence,
and with a strong grade of recommendation, particularly if the waiting
time on the list is expected to be at least 6 months. Progression after
endovascular therapies seems to have a prognostic role, and treatment
response is a surrogate biomarker \[32\]. TACE is the most used
technique for bridging, although no trial has demonstrated its
superiority over the remaining locoregional strategies \[33\]. Ettore et
al. \[34\] demonstrated that bridging is achievable in all patients
using TARE. Gabr et al. report their experience of 207 transplants after
TARE with a bridging success of 75% with survival similar to
non-oncologic transplant \[35\]. Nevertheless, Lee et al. \[36\] suggest
that the impact of the bridging strategy is limited only to the early
stage.

9.3.6 Palliation

The palliative indication is reserved for those patients not amenable
for curative treatment. Despite a trend in the data \[37--39\] there are
no conclusive trials that demonstrate the superiority of a TARE versus
C-TACE or DEB-TACE \[40\], TACE still being the first treatment option
in all guidelines. The TRACE trial (BCLC stage A/B) was interrupted
because of the clear superiority of TARE in terms of time to progression
(392 vs. 299 days) and overall survival (912 vs. 489 days) \[41\]. The
CIRT registry demonstrated that TARE is a valid tool with an excellent
safety profile for palliation \[42\]. Moreover, Salem et al. published
their institutional decision to adopt TARE as the first treatment option
in limited HCC, based on 1000 patients in 15 years \[43\].

9.4 Conclusion

Transarterial treatments (TACE and TARE) are the past, the present and
the future of HCC management. TACE has proven its utility in randomized
trials and TARE has earned its place in the real world of HCC treatment,
entering recently the first stage of BCLC.

evaluation

10.1 Introduction

Liver resection (LR) still remains one of the main curative options for
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). When HCC is diagnosed in the cirrhotic
liver, the indication for LR should be carefully established. The
assessment of such patients should not consider only tumor burden, but
must also necessarily include an accurate evaluation of the preoperative
liver function to reduce the risk of the most feared complication
following LR, that is, post-hepatectomy liver failure (PHLF). PHLF
represents the most important cause of postoperative 90-day mortality
and is the most commonly used measure to assess the early postoperative
outcome. The evaluation of liver function includes assessment of
functional reserve of the cirrhotic liver, presence of portal
hypertension, extent of LR, volume of functional remnant liver (FRLV),
patient performance status and comorbidities. Furthermore, LR should be
carefully evaluated against liver transplantation, when this can be a
chance of cure, and other potentially curative therapies such as
ablation.

10.2 Hepatic Functional Reserve Assessment

Several tools are available to evaluate liver function and to stratify
the risk of PHLF, but there is no general agreement on the best to be
used worldwide.

10.2.1 Child-Turcotte-Pugh Score

The Child-Turcotte-Pugh score is frequently used because it is a simple
system including five easily available variables. In the majority of
Western \[1, 2\] and Eastern guidelines \[3\] there is a wide consensus
that patients with cirrhosis Child-Pugh A are good candidates for LR.
However, PHLF may occur also in Child-Pugh A patients \[4\], because the
score does not capture different levels of liver function in the same
class of patients. This drawback, defined as the "floor effect" \[4\],
is often associated with the use of the Child-Pugh score, which usually
works better in patients with decompensated cirrhosis than in patients
with preserved liver function where identifying those with elevated risk
of PHLF is crucial.

10.2.2 Model for End-Stage Liver Disease

The model for end-stage liver disease (MELD), developed to predict
survival following transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt
procedure, is another easily available tool that is effective in
predicting PHLF, but once again it has limited capacity for risk
stratification in patients not affected by end-stage cirrhosis. Recent
evidence has shown that good candidates for LR should have a MELD score
≤10 and therefore it was recently included in the European Association
for the Study of the Liver (EASL) guidelines, with Child-Pugh score, for
treatment allocation \[2, 5, 6\]. Indeed, above this cut-off the
reported morbidity rate reached 50%, with an unacceptable risk of
irreversible PHLF (up to 15%) \[5, 6\].

10.2.3 Indocyanine Green Clearance Test

More accurate liver function evaluation can be obtained with the use of
other tests, including the indocyanine green (ICG) clearance test,
widely used in Asia. It is a dynamic method for studying liver function.
It evaluates the hepatic clearance of indocyanine green 15 min after
intravenous administration (ICG-R15) \[7, 8\]. The safe cut-off ICG
retention rate at 15 min, which allows major hepatectomy, is around 10%
\[9\]. A decision algorithm developed by Makuuchi guides the extent of
hepatectomy. Three variables are included: ascites, serum total
bilirubin level and ICG-R15 \[9\]. The presence of ascites with serum
total bilirubin level ≥2 mg/dL is an absolute contraindication for LR.
In patients without ascites and normal serum total bilirubin level, the
extent of LR is planned according to the ICG-R15 value: major LR should
only be performed in patients with ICG-R15 \<10--20%, and limited LR
when ICG-R15 is \<40% \[9\]. Therefore the ICG-R15 may be useful for
guiding the extent of LR and for stratifying the risk of PHLF in
Child-Pugh A patients.

10.2.4 Other Liver Function Scoring Systems

Other scoring systems have been proposed to overcome the limitations of
the Child-Pugh classification. These are used in different centers,
according to different local expertise levels and protocols. These
include: the aspartate transaminase-to-platelet ratio index (APRI) score
\[10\], the albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) score \[11\], the
albumin-indocyanine green evaluation (ALICE) score \[12\] and the
bilirubin-cholinesterase (BILCHE) score \[13\].

10.2.5 Evaluation of Portal Hypertension

According to the EASL guidelines \[2\], clinical signs of portal
hypertension (PH) include the presence of esophageal varices, or
splenomegaly (diameter \>12 cm) and platelet count \<100,000/mm3.
Non-invasive assessment of fibrosis grade by liver stiffness measurement
with transient elastography is an additional effective tool for
assessing the degree of PH, which has gained more clinical diffusion
than invasive measurement of HVGP. The degree of liver stiffness may
identify patients at risk of PHLF, with a significant risk of PHLF being
predicted by liver stiffness \>12--14 kPa \[14\]. The presence of PH is
a significant prognostic factor affecting postoperative outcome \[2\].
In such patients the risk of PHLF following major LR is \>30% with a
90-day postoperative mortality reaching 25%. However, PH in itself
should not be considered an absolute contraindication to LR if liver
function is preserved. In selected Child-Pugh A patients, with PH and
well-compensated cirrhosis, limited LR can be performed with competitive
survival outcomes \[15--17\]. For this reason, the role of PH in
evaluating the indication for LR should always be balanced with the
extent of resection and liver function tests.

10.2.6 Extent of Liver Resection and Functional Remnant Liver Volume
Evaluation

A critical issue is the FRLV following LR. A computed tomography
(CT)-based volumetric assessment is generally used to evaluate the FRLV;
a value ranging from 40% to 50% may be considered the safe limit for LR
in the cirrhotic liver to prevent severe PHLF \[18\] (Figs. 10.1, 10.2
and 10.3). For this reason, strategies to increase FRLV or reduce the
HCC and expand resectability have been developed: portal vein
embolization (PVE) (Fig. 10.1); preoperative transarterial
chemoembolization (TACE) alone (Fig. 10.2), or followed by PVE \[19\];
combined hepatic vein embolization and PVE (liver venous deprivation)
\[20\]; radioembolization with yttrium-90 microspheres \[21\]; portal
vein ligation for staged hepatectomy (ALPPS) procedure \[22\].

10.3 Indications According to Tumor Stage, Survival Benefit, and
Technical Considerations

Accurate tumor staging is crucial to evaluate the indication for LR. The
Barcelona Clínic Liver Cancer (BCLC) staging system is one of the most
widely used in Western countries \[2\]. It provides a survival
benefit-based treatment algorithm, associated with a prognostic staging
system consisting of four variables: tumor burden, degree of liver
function, general condition of the patient and treatment efficacy.
According to the BCLC system, LR is restricted to a selected group of
patients without PH, with very early (single nodule \<2 cm) or early
(tumors within the Milan criteria: single nodule ≤5 cm or 2--3 nodules
≤3 cm) tumor stage (BCLC stage 0--A). However, this type of treatment
algorithm may prove rigid, as it gives only one treatment option for
each tumor stage and it is not open to treatment alternatives \[23\].
This algorithm is not regularly followed in real-life clinical practice
throughout the world. In fact, several studies have shown a potential
role of surgery also for patients with large multinodular and
macrovascular invasive HCC, classified as BCLC stage B/C, or with
biliary invasion (Fig. 10.3). A recent multicenter study \[24\] reported
that about 50% of patients with intermediate or advanced stage HCC (BCLC
stage B/C) are routinely treated with LR in tertiary referral centers
worldwide. Furthermore, the study showed that the 5-year overall
survival (OS) of BCLC stage B/C patients following LR was 57% and 38%,
respectively.

Based on these observations, with the aim of improving the accuracy of
treatment indications for HCC in cirrhotic patients, the concept of
"therapeutic hierarchy" strategies has been proposed, which introduces a
relative independence between the choice of treatment and the stage of
disease \[23\]. This allows us to tailor the indications to the single
patient and avoid the risk of undertreatment with the rigid application
of a simple stage-linked treatment algorithm. However, the decision of
the first treatment is complex because it requires consideration of
several factors that can only be evaluated within a multidisciplinary
dedicated team of experts.

As regards the indication for LR, from the technical point of view, one
significant improvement was the introduction and wide diffusion of
minimally invasive LR for HCC in cirrhotic patients: currently, HCC is
the most frequent indication for a laparoscopic LR \[25\]. The
advantages of minimally invasive surgery are particularly significant in
cirrhotic patients, with overall better perioperative outcomes than open
surgery, and in particular with a lower incidence of PHLF and of
postoperative ascites. This has made it possible to consider the
extension of surgical indications to selected Child B patients \[26\].
Furthermore, the significantly reduced surgical risk of laparoscopic LR
for HCC in cirrhotic patients, particularly for small HCC, allows
reappraisal of the competitive indications between ablation and surgery,
in favor of resection. Laparoscopic LR also has a significant role in
patients with indications for liver transplantation, as a bridge
treatment before transplant, with advantages relating not only to
limited postoperative adhesions but also to the possibility of obtaining
relevant prognostic information from the surgical specimen before a
definitive indication for transplantation.

10.4 Need for a Multidisciplinary Evaluation in High-Volume Centers

It should be highlighted that the indications for LR in cirrhotic
patients should be assessed in a multidisciplinary setting in
high-volume centers, where the presence of experienced liver and
transplant surgeons, hepatologists, anesthesiologists, interventional
radiologists and endoscopists, specialized dietitians together with
dedicated intensive care unit and high-level nursing care, may all
contribute to prevent mortality following LR. Recent advances in
surgical technique, patient selection, and perioperative management have
contributed to decrease the postoperative mortality rate to \<5% in most
centers following LR for HCC. However, although reduced by accurate
patient selection, the occurrence of postoperative complications, may be
unavoidable even in high-volume centers. A new parameter proposed to
assess the quality of care during hospitalization is failure to rescue
(FTR), defined as the probability of postoperative death among patients
with a major complication. FTR reflects the ability to rescue a patient
with a major complication from the risk of death. FTR has been shown to
decrease significantly with increasing hospital volumes. A recent
multicenter Italian study \[27\] on 1935 patients undergoing resection,
showed that the risk of major complications and mortality was related to
comorbidities, cirrhosis severity, and complexity of surgery, but these
factors were not correlated with FTR. Indeed, the center's volume was
the only independent predictor related to severe complications,
mortality, and FTR. In other words, the ability to rescue a patient from
a major complication was strictly correlated with the center's volume
and was significantly lower in high-volume centers. Centralization could
be one prerequisite for proper indications and improved outcomes
following LR for HCC.

Hepatocellular carcinomaCirrhosisLaparoscopic liver resectionMinimally
invasive liver resectionAscitesHepatectomy

11.1 Introduction

Laparoscopic liver resection (LLR) was born in 1991 and gradually
expanded during the following thirty years \[1\]. Even extremely complex
procedures are performed in centers with adequate experience \[2, 3\].

Curative treatments for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) include liver
resection (LR) and local ablation therapy, which can now be performed
using the laparoscopic technique. Moreover, laparoscopy is increasingly
being used to expand the indications for surgical treatment for HCC
patients, being able to overcome some of the limits or issues linked to
traditional open LR.

11.2 Short-Term Outcomes

Many studies have documented the feasibility and safety of LLR and
reported advantages with respect to perioperative outcomes. Among the
most frequent are the reduction of blood loss, transfusion needs,
complications, and length of hospital stay, as well as earlier recovery
of physiological functions and patient's autonomy. This is extremely
important for HCC, since hepatectomy in cirrhosis is associated with
higher complication rates than other conventional settings. In many
studies focusing on HCC, the benefits of laparoscopy have been
particularly evident and often associated with specific advantages. Of
particular interest is the reduction of ascites, a very fearful and
frequent complication in the cirrhotic patient, which laparoscopy is
able to contain by avoiding large abdominal incisions, thus allowing the
surgeon to preserve the parietal circulation and lymphatics and to limit
the dispersion of fluids \[4, 5\]. Also, the incidence of postoperative
liver failure was shown to be reduced by many studies \[6\]. These
results have been supported by various meta-analyses including a large
number of HCC patients. In 2018, Chen et al. performed a systematic
review of high-quality case-matched studies: regardless of whether the
patients underwent minor or major hepatectomy, ascites was less in LLR
than in open LR, and patients undergoing laparoscopy were less likely to
suffer liver failure \[7\].

11.3 Long-Term Outcomes

Most of the studies and meta-analyses showing the short-term advantages
of LLR for HCC have also revealed long-term results similar to those of
open LR \[8\]. Few recent publications reported improved survival rates,
suggesting a possible long-term advantage on the oncological side. A
meta-analysis of 888 HCC patients showed higher 1-, 3- and 5-year
overall survival rates and 1-year disease-free survival rate for LLR
than for open surgery; moreover, tumor recurrence was also lower \[9\].
The improved long-term outcomes of LLR are explained by the authors as
likely due to decreased blood loss and higher rates of negative surgical
margins. In 2021, Sun et al. performed a meta-analysis based on
reconstructed time-to-event data of propensity score studies. The
results suggested that laparoscopy can improve recurrence-free survival
in HCC patients undergoing minor hepatectomy \[10\].

11.4 Advanced Cirrhosis and Portal Hypertension

Laparoscopy is increasingly used to push the limits for LR to those
categories of HCC patients for whom open surgery entails a significant
risk of major complications and mortality, i.e., to patients with
advanced cirrhosis and portal hypertension.

One study reported that Child A and Child B patients receiving LLR had a
similar perioperative course as there was no difference in blood loss,
blood transfusions, overall morbidity, postoperative mortality, or
liver-specific complications, such as ascites decompensation and liver
failure \[11\]. Moreover, clinically significant portal hypertension was
not a risk factor for major morbidity. Some retrospective studies
explored the perioperative and long-term effect of LLR on HCC patients
with clinically significant portal hypertension, showing comparable
overall survival to non-portal hypertension groups \[12, 13\]. Thus,
laparoscopy may offer a protective effect with regard to postoperative
liver failure, ascites and major complications even in Child B patients,
and its role in extending the candidacy to LR is currently being further
investigated on the basis of fresh promising evidence \[14\].

11.5 Major Hepatectomies

Major LLR were first performed in 1998 but have undergone a slow
diffusion due to their technical difficulty and fears of poor bleeding
control \[15\]. Even today, despite their proven safety and feasibility,
it is recognized that major LLR must be carried out in the presence of
high levels of expertise and experience \[16\].

In 2019, a multicenter propensity score-based comparative study of 1355
patients reported that major LLR were associated with reduced blood
loss, postoperative stay and morbidity than open LR, also in the setting
of malignant disease \[17\].

In the last few years, the results of single-center studies on major LLR
have disclosed favorable results for HCC, further confirmed by more than
one systematic review. In a meta-analysis of 780 patients, Chen et al.
found major LLR to be associated with less intraoperative blood loss and
morbidity and shorter postoperative stay despite longer operative times,
concluding that it may serve as a promising alternative to open LR
\[18\]. In 2019, Wang et al. considered 1173 HCC patients who underwent
laparoscopic and open major hepatectomies, obtaining similar results
\[19\]. Thus, major LLR can be performed safely in patients with HCC,
who are often affected by large lesions \[20\]. Especially in these
settings, the anterior approach can be applied to respect the no-touch
principles of oncological surgery \[21\].

11.6 Repeat Surgery

Most HCC arise on a background of chronic liver disease, which can cause
intrahepatic recurrence after a first LR and consequently expose
patients to the need for repeated hepatectomies. The operative advantage
that can derive from a first surgery performed by laparoscopy is the
benefit on intra-abdominal adhesions thanks to the limited manipulation
of organs \[22, 23\]. By decreasing the need for adhesiolysis, the
surgical time of repeated LR after a first laparoscopic surgery has been
shown to be reduced compared to a first open surgery \[24\]. It should
be emphasized that, although repeated LR are complex operations due to
the distortion of the parenchyma that follows previous resections and
the consequent alteration of the original anatomy, they are nevertheless
still associated with perioperative advantages for patients. In 2021,
the results of an international multicenter study evaluating the
surgical results of repeated LLR for relapsed HCC revealed reduced
intraoperative blood loss and complications for the laparoscopic group
\[25\].

11.7 Elderly Patients

The laparoscopic approach has also yielded interesting results for the
treatment of patients with advanced age \[26\]. For HCC, Nomi et al.
disclosed the results of a multicenter retrospective propensity-based
study on 630 HCC patients aged ≥75 years. As compared to open surgery,
intraoperative blood loss, transfusion and morbidity were lower for LLR,
including major, cardiovascular and pulmonary complications as well as
180-day mortality for causes other than HCC- or liver-related causes.
Moreover, for octogenarians, laparoscopy was associated with decreased
major morbidity and length of stay \[27\]. In 2021, a multicenter
propensity-matched study including 184 HCC patients aged \>70 years
undergoing laparoscopic or open major LR was performed. Laparoscopy was
confirmed to be associated with reduced complications and duration of
stay with mortality comparable to open surgery \[28\]. Hence, age should
not be considered a contraindication to LLR for HCC, even for major
resections, since the benefits of minimal invasiveness are also
confirmed for this category of fragile patients.

11.8 Difficulty Scores

The concept of difficulty is crucial in guiding safely the development
of LLR expertise and learning curve. Particular attention has been given
to the many factors influencing the complexity of an operation, some
related to the topography and nature of the liver injury, others
intrinsic to the type of operation, others related to the
characteristics of the patient. As a result, various difficulty scoring
systems (DSS) to predict surgical difficulty have been produced in
recent years. The most popular are the IWATE-DSS, Halls-DSS,
Hasegawa-DSS, and Kawaguchi-DSS \[29--32\].

Lin et al. conducted a single-center study specifically designed to
validate these scores in HCC patients \[33\]. They found significant
distributions of applying bleeding control, surgical time, estimated
blood loss, postoperative major complications and hospital stay among
different groups of each system, and that the IWATE-DSS was also able to
predict conversion.

Additionally, in 2020 Goh et al. raised attention regarding the effect
of cirrhosis on the difficulty of a LLR, given that none of the four
existing DSS included its presence/absence as a determinant factor (only
the IWATE-DSS considered Child B cirrhosis as a significant factor, but
without distinguishing between patients with Child A liver function and
patients with non-cirrhotic livers) \[34\].

In general, all the DSS show different profiles of utility. As a
reasonable approach, we have made the proposal to use the "Kawaguchi-,
IWATE-, and Halls-DSS" order for: a first assessment based on the type
of operation and exclusion if the learning curve has not yet been
overcome; a second stratification within procedures of the same
complexity to guide towards progression to the next phase of difficulty;
a final evaluation to estimate intraoperative complications and
adequately prepare the equipment and team \[35\].

11.9 Laparoscopic Approach for Local Ablation Therapy

With the accumulation of evidence on its efficacy, ablation has become a
viable treatment for HCC and liver malignancies. For HCC, it has moved
from palliative to potentially curative treatment in selected patients
\[36\]. The spread of laparoscopy has allowed its adoption for
ablations, especially in the presence of limitations due to the
percutaneous approach (mainly unfavorable localizations). Furthermore,
laparoscopy has the clear advantage of providing real-time monitoring of
the ablative process and hemostasis. Some studies have indeed reported a
lower complication rate and shorter length of stay for laparoscopic
compared with percutaneous ablations \[37\]. One study also reported
comparable local tumor progression rates \[38\]. However, definitive
conclusions on the oncological non-inferiority of laparoscopic ablations
are still awaited, as well as validation of their role as a first-choice
curative treatment for selected patients.

11.10 Conclusion

LLR has been performed worldwide with oncologic outcomes for HCC
comparable to open surgery. The evidence is based on case-control
studies, propensity score-matched studies and meta-analyses. Although
most of the reports of LLR refer to Child A cirrhotic patients, some
studies have demonstrated the feasibility of LLR in selected patients
with advanced cirrhosis, for which laparoscopy can extend the
indications for surgery. Future studies will need to clarify further
which patients with advanced cirrhosis and HCC are most suitable for a
minimally invasive approach and elucidate the role of laparoscopy for
laparoscopic ablations.

Hepatocellular carcinomaRobotic surgeryMinimally invasive surgeryLiver
functionLiver transplantationALPPS

12.1 Introduction

Minimally invasive liver surgery has demonstrated several benefits over
the classical open approach \[1\]. In addition to the reduction of
morbidity and shorter in-hospital stay compared to the standard open
procedure \[2\], the robot reduces the conversion rate compared to
laparoscopy in the setting of high-difficulty procedures, ultimately
increasing surgical safety \[3\]. Therefore, adopting a robotic approach
may increase the opportunity for patients to be treated without losing
the advantages of minimally invasive surgery, even when a complex
procedure is needed \[4, 5\]. In this chapter we will briefly review
some key points for a better understanding of the robotic approach to
the liver and its application in the field of hepatocellular carcinoma
(HCC).

12.2 Patient Selection and Indications

The indication for surgical resection in a modern hepatobiliary center
should be always discussed in a multidisciplinary meeting involving
surgeons, radiologists, anestesiologists, hepatologists and oncologists,
to ensure the accuracy and appropriateness of the therapeutic strategy
\[6, 7\]. Indocyanine green (ICG) clearance and evaluation of portal
hypertension measuring the hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) may
help to refine the indication and prevent post-hepatectomy liver failure
\[8\]. Up to now there are no formal contraindications to performing a
robotic liver resection, except the general contraindication for
pneumoperitoneum. The presence of macrovascular tumor infiltration,
large exophytic tumors, and the need for major vascular reconstructions
can be considered relative contraindications for the robotic approach,
and the decision to include those patients relies on the experience of
the center. Cirrhotic patients with HVPG \>10 mmHg should be evaluated
case by case, according to the extension of the resection needed. In the
case of repeated resections, minimally invasive approaches and in
particular the use of the robot proved to be safe and effective \[9,
10\].

12.3 Surgical Technique and Learning Curve

12.3.1 Patient Positioning and System Set-Up

Even if other robotic systems are available on the market, most of the
evidence produced in the literature so far was obtained using DaVinci
robotic platforms (Intuitive Surgical Inc., Sunnyvale, CA, United
States), and therefore we are going to discuss details of the most
recent model. The DaVinci platform includes a surgeon's console, a
patient-side cart and a vision system. Patients are usually positioned
supine, 15° to 20° anti-Trendelenburg and can be rotated to the left to
allow easier access to right and posterior segments. The position of the
trocars varies according to each patient's peculiar conformation and
lesion localization, and to the robotic platform in use \[11\]. Using
the Xi platform, the first step, according to the manufacturer, is to
determine the target anatomy, which is not the disease location but the
area where the midline of the surgical workspace intersects the far edge
of the surgical workspace boundary. The initial endoscope port should be
placed 10 to 20 cm back from the target anatomy, on the opposite edge of
the surgical workspace boundary. The other ports are usually placed on a
straight line perpendicular to the target anatomy: for liver procedures
two arms are controlled with the right hand (left sided), and one with
the left hand (right sided). The trocars should be placed 6 to 10 cm
apart according to patient body habitus, and at least 2 cm away from
bony structures. Assistant ports can be inserted at least 7 cm from
robotic ports, with adequate triangulation to enable the table-side
surgeon to reach the desired anatomy and to ensure physical access to
the port.

12.3.2 Use of Indocyanine Green-Based Fluorescence

Another novel feature is the integrated Firefly, an indocyanine green
(ICG)-based fluorescence imaging system. This technology has several
applications to reach the goal of a personalized and tailored surgery.
In liver surgery, ICG fluorescence can be used for tumor identification,
surface mapping, and real-time cholangiography \[12, 13\]. Tumor cells
can be either hypo-fluorescent or hyper-fluorescent according to their
histological features: well-differentiated HCCs show a homogeneous
fluorescence pattern, while poorly differentiated HCCs demonstrate an
inhomogeneous or even a rim-type fluorescence pattern \[12\]. For this
kind of visualization an intravenous injection of 0.5 mg/kg bodyweight
of ICG is recommended 2--14 days prior to surgery. This recommendation
is based on studies and observations in patients that underwent surgery
after an ICG clearance test, which explains the dose and the timing. In
our experience, a dose of 0.25 mg/kg bodyweight 12 h before surgery is
effective for HCC visualization in non-cirrhotic patients (Fig. 12.1).
ICG fluorescence can be also used for definition of segmental anatomy as
mentioned above, with two different techniques: positive and negative
staining. In the negative staining method, the inflow vessels of the
hepatic parenchyma to be removed must be temporarily clamped to confirm
the demarcation line, followed by systemic injection of 2.5 mg of ICG,
resulting in fluorescent enhancement of the hepatic parenchyma to be
preserved \[14\]. The positive staining technique requires direct
injection of 2.5 mg ICG diluted in 10 mL of saline solution into the
tumor-bearing portal branch through a 16-gauge needle. This way, the
segment to be removed becomes fluorescence-enhanced on the liver surface
and can be marked with monopolar energy to guide the transection between
fluorescing and non-fluorescing parenchyma \[14\].

12.3.3 Parenchymal Transection

For parenchymal transection we adopt a Kelly crush technique with the
use of bipolar forceps, combined with monopolar energy and use of the
DaVinci Harmonic ACE (Ethicon, Somerville, NJ, USA) for deeper layers
(Fig. 12.2). The robotic platform does not support liver-specific
devices for parenchyma dissection such as the Cavitron Ultrasonic
Surgical Aspirator (CUSA); however, it can be used by the table-side
surgeon even though this approach is not comfortable and requires
placing the assistant port very high. Moreover, the transection line is
determined by the surgeon using the CUSA rather than the
console-surgeon. From this perspective, the use of the CUSA from the
table-side dispels most of the advantages of the robotic approach and,
for those reasons, it does not represent our first choice.

It is well known that non-anatomical liver resections are more difficult
to be approached with minimally invasive strategies compared to the
straight transection plane of major hepatectomies. Under this
perspective, the robot adds several benefits thanks to instrument
flexibility and 3-D visualization, which help to reach deep and narrow
spaces such as posterior segments, with safe control of vascular
structures.

12.4 Postoperative Outcomes

Several studies assessed that robotic surgery is as safe as open and
laparoscopic approaches for HCC in terms of operative complications and
postoperative morbidity. However, among all the interesting papers
published in recent years, few studies focused on the oncological
outcomes after robotic liver resection. Choi et al. in their series
reported 13 HCC patients all with negative margins and a 92.3% rate of
anatomic resection, without recurrences during the 11-month median
follow-up \[15\]. In an Eastern series of 183 patients with HCC treated
with robotic liver resection compared to 275 open surgery controls, the
robotic group showed longer operation times (343 vs. 220 min), shorter
hospital stays (7.5 vs. 10.1 days), and lower dosages of postoperative
patient-controlled analgesia (350 vs. 554 ng/kg) \[16\]. Overall
survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) at 3 years after robotic
liver resection for HCC are reported to range between 97.7--92.6% and
72.2--71.9%, respectively \[17\]. The use of the robot proved to be safe
and effective also in the field of advanced liver procedures such as
associated liver partition and portal vein ligation for staged
hepatectomy (ALPPS) for HCC \[18, 19\].

12.5 Role of Robotics in Transplant Oncology

Given the abovementioned characteristics of the technology, the robot is
a valuable tool for bridging and down-staging strategies \[20--22\] and
an alternative to locoregional treatments like percutaneous ablation
(PA) \[23, 24\]. The cumulative incidence of recurrence was found to be
decreased in the robotic group versus the PA group in a cohort of very
early and early newly diagnosed HCCs \[25\]. The underlying reason for
this different recurrence pattern can be found in the 20% incidence of
satellitosis, which is more efficiently treated with a surgical
approach. Besides, the robotic approach may ultimately reduce the
formation of abdominal adhesions for future liver transplantation
\[22\].

Similarly to the ALPPS, the partition concept of the liver has its basis
in the living-donor liver procurement, which today probably represents
the highest expression of robotic liver surgery. In an experience from
Korea reporting on 52 cases, the authors applied selection criteria at
the beginning of the series including less complex cases before
approaching advanced vascular variants or larger grafts \[26\]. The
results are outstanding, with low blood loss (109.8 ± 101.5 mL),
acceptable operative time (493.6 ± 91.5 min) and short in-hospital stay
(9 ± 2.1 days), with a statistically significant advantage over the open
approach. The incidence of postoperative morbidity was 23.1%, with only
one case of a complication \>3a, according to Clavien-Dindo.

12.6 Conclusions

The robotic approach to the liver is a safe, effective and reproducible
strategy for the treatment of HCC, from non-anatomical resections to
more advanced procedures, including ALPPS and living-donor hepatectomy.
Perioperative and long-term outcomes are at least comparable to the
traditional open approach, with additional benefits for cirrhotic
patients and those with CSPH, thus reducing the incidence of PHLF and
postoperative morbidity, and expanding the indications for surgical
resections for HCC.

13.1 Introduction

Hepatic surgery has had an extraordinary evolution in recent decades,
becoming a standardized, routinely performed procedure that has reached
near-zero mortality rates and offers a chance of cure to many cancer
patients. Anesthesia and technical refinements, together with
technological innovations, are some of the factors responsible for the
improvements in this field. Regarding surgical technique, two main
revolutions have contributed to these developments: the diffusion of
parenchymal-sparing surgery (PSS) instead of major/extended
hepatectomies and the spread of the minimally invasive (laparoscopic and
robotic) rather than the open approach.

PSS aims to preserve as much healthy functional liver parenchyma as
possible without compromising the principles of oncological surgery. An
independent association of the number of resected segments with
postoperative complications and mortality rate is clearly described. As
a consequence, PSS is associated with a significant reduction in the
rates of postoperative morbidity (e.g., liver failure) and mortality.
Finally, some studies have reported better overall survival for patients
treated with PSS compared with major resections, due to a higher
likelihood of undergoing salvage hepatectomy for recurrence. PSS was
initially proposed in patients with colorectal liver metastases (CRLM).
Driven by the good results obtained with PSS in CRLM, liver surgeons
started thinking they could "spare the liver parenchyma" also in
patients with a diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

Laparoscopic liver resection (LLR) has gained widespread acceptance
after two international and one European consensus conferences. It has
been reported as a safe procedure with advantages over open surgery in
terms of morbidity, blood loss, and postoperative hospital stay \[1\].
At the same time, the long-term results seem to be at least non inferior
to open liver resections in patients with CRLM and HCC. Finally, there
is emerging evidence that LLR is associated with better oncological
outcomes for HCC when compared to radiofrequency ablation.

In the past, liver surgery for HCC was associated with high rates of
mortality and liver failure due to the underlying cirrhosis and poor
functional reserve of the liver. Today, the fragility of these patients
remains and should not be forgotten, but the combination of PSS and LLR
under intraoperative ultrasound (IOUS) guidance has allowed the
extension of indications to more complex patients and diseases.

13.2 The Role of Ultrasound in Liver Surgery

While recent technological advances have enhanced the diagnostic
performance of computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR)
imaging, IOUS provides complementary and specific information for
intraoperative tumor staging. In addition, IOUS plays a pivotal role at
each step of the surgical decision-making process, especially for
surgical planning and guidance during open and laparoscopic liver
resections. In the next section the aid provided by IOUS in all these
phases will be described, with special attention to HCC surgery.

13.2.1 Intraoperative Tumor Staging

The clinical diagnosis and staging of HCC are currently based on CT and
MR imaging. Nonetheless, CT and MR imaging have generally low
sensitivity for small lesions (\<1 cm). Since IOUS scanning is always
performed directly on the liver surface, very high-resolution images can
be obtained. With current transducer resolutions, lesions as small as 2
mm can be identified with a sensitivity of 90--95%. In cirrhotic livers,
IOUS can detect up to 30% more lesions, compared to preoperative
imaging. However, more frequently such additional nodules tend to be of
a regenerative nature. Therefore, to improve the specificity of basic
IOUS in cirrhotic patients and help in the differential diagnosis of
small undetermined lesions, new diagnostic tools have been implemented
\[1\], such as contrast-enhanced IOUS (CE-IOUS) and elastography.
Moreover, the IOUS patterns of HCC nodules correlate with grading and
microvascular invasion, thus providing real-time prognostic data on the
risk of tumor recurrence.

13.2.2 Surgical Planning and Resection Guidance

To be considered resectable, a lesion must be removable with a negative
margin and allow for the preservation of sufficient functional liver
segments with an adequate portal and arterial inflow, venous outflow and
biliary drainage. Thus, a precise understanding of the patient's liver
anatomy, tumor localization and topographical relationships are needed
for a correct liver resection.

The four-Cs method \[2, 3\] is an effective and pragmatic four-step
technique able to highlight the role of IOUS in both planning (steps 1
and 2) and guiding the resection (steps 3 and 4).1.

Compose the 3-D mind map The first step is to perform an in-depth
ultrasound study of the relationships between the lesion and the
surrounding vessels that are to be correctly identified in order to
create a 3-D anatomical mind map.

2\.

Create the sketch The underlying anatomical structures are sketched on
the liver surface with cautery (Fig. 13.1a), the goal being to help the
surgeon to hold in mind the map of the liver anatomy relative to the
lesion. Lines of transection are drawn according to the sketch, thus
planning which vessel will be ligated and cut and which will be
preserved and exposed on the cut surface.

3\.

Check the way The sketch shows only the glissonean projection of deeper
structures, so it is necessary to check the section plane while
proceeding with the transection. The resection line is easily visualized
as an inhomogeneous hyperechoic linear artefact in the parenchyma, so
the surgeon can check the resection plane with respect to relationships
with the hepatic veins, portal pedicles, and surgical margin at any
time.

4\.

Correct the direction The direction of the section plane is not always
initially correct. The correct angle of incidence at which to start the
resection may not be obvious; often the direction has to be adjusted to
stay clear of the lesion, to reach a pedicle at the correct distance
from its origin, or to reach a structure that will be spared and
followed up (Fig. 13.2).

sketch of all the landmarks is completed: middle (MHV) and right (RHV)

allowing a safer margin with the tumor (T)

13.3 Parenchymal Sparing Surgery for Hepatocellular Carcinoma: Surgical
Technique

PSS for HCC encompasses a wide range of liver resections, ranging from
minor anatomical resections (AR)---e.g., bi/segmentectomies and
subsegmentectomies---to more or less complex non-anatomical resections
(non-AR). For all these procedures IOUS has a crucial role both in
planning and guiding the liver resection. The main steps of these
procedures, with both the open and laparoscopic approach, are described
below.

13.3.1 Ultrasound-Guided Minor Anatomical Resections

AR are challenging due to the lack of clear separation of segments in
the liver. The fundamental landmarks to determine
intersegmental/sectional boundaries are (1) the landmark veins, (2) the
feeding glissonean pedicles, and (3) the ischemic demarcation line. IOUS
helps surgeons to identify the two main transection planes needed to
perform an AR:The longitudinal plane that runs along one or more hepatic
veins: for example, in cases of S8 segmentectomy there are two
longitudinal planes, the one of the right hepatic vein (on the lateral
part of the cut surface) and the one of the middle hepatic vein (on the
medial part). These landmarks are easily identified with IOUS through a
sliding movement of the probe on the liver surface with a longitudinal
or transversal view.

The transverse plane that runs along the root of tributary glissonean
pedicles: in the above example of S8 segmentectomy the transverse plane
runs along the anterior portal branch between the pedicles of segment 8
(to be ligated) and segment 5 (to be spared).

During AR, the longitudinal and transverse planes are connected to each
other by the surgeons. In this phase IOUS allows the surgeon to check
and, if necessary, correct the transection plane in real time. Once
reached, the tributary can be managed with different approaches: dye
stain portal injection, US-guided pedicle compression or isolation and
ligation (Fig. 13.1b). The first two techniques can be difficult to
perform in some cases (e.g., posterior segments) and are not
reproducible in laparoscopy.

In the laparoscopic US-guided anatomical ventral approach, the
glissonean pedicle is reached in an advanced stage of parenchymal
transection as opposed to the glissonean pedicle-first approach \[4\].
This technique (suitable for anatomical segmentectomies and
subsegmentectomies of segment 7 and 6 and for Sg6--7 bisegmentectomies)
is based on the ultrasonographic identification of the right posterior
or segmental pedicle from the dorsal side of the liver after complete
mobilization. The pedicle of interest is isolated through
mini-hepatotomy and clamped.

Ligation of tributary glissonean pedicle (with ventral or glissonean
pedicle-first approach) allows identification of the last AR landmark:
the ischemic area on the liver surface (Fig. 13.1c). The use of
indocyanine green fluorescence technique makes the ischemia apparent
also inside the liver parenchyma, facilitating parenchymal liver
transection.

Thanks to the remarkable advances in radiological imaging and surgical
techniques, it is emerging that liver anatomy is definitively more
complex than described by Couinaud. Takasaky et al. \[5\] defined "cone
unit" as the smallest anatomical part of the liver, supplied by a
tertiary branch and with the base on the hepatic surface and the apex
toward the hilum. Majno et al. \[6\] recently reported that the median
number of 2nd-order branches given off by the left and right portal vein
was 20 (range: 9--44). In agreement with this new anatomical knowledge,
in each segment it is possible to identify many independent anatomical
subsegments fed by a tertiary pedicle that can be separately resected.

However, considering the high anatomical variation of the secondary and
tertiary branches of the hepatic veins and portal pedicles and the
absence of extrahepatic landmarks for these smaller liver units, IOUS
has become the only instrument able to identify the "real anatomy" and
to plan subsegmentectomy correctly.

13.3.2 Ultrasound-Guided Non-anatomical Resections

The role of IOUS for resection guidance is crucial not only in
anatomical but also in non-anatomical resection. It can be used during
both open and laparoscopic non-AR with different goals:1.

To identify and reach the vascular structures to be ligated and the
right level of the ligature. In this way, laparoscopic US can prevent
iatrogenic injury of tributaries to non tumor-bearing liver parenchyma
while reducing the risk of major bleeding.

2\.

To identify the hepatic vein root to be followed inside the liver as a
landmark boundary between subsegments or segments. According to the
tumor position, type of segment and liver morphology, the hepatic vein
root can be approached with a cranial or caudal approach.

3\.

To study venous drainage of the remnant liver (Fig. 13.3). Tumors
involving the hepatic veins at the hepatocaval confluence often require
major or extended hepatectomies. The use of intraoperative color Doppler
US, first described by Sano et al. \[7\], is most important in the
evaluation of liver hemodynamics to assess venous congestion in the
remaining liver when the main hepatic veins are clamped. The lack of
alternative drainage routes to one or more hepatic veins (e.g.,
venovenous shunts or accessory veins) in these patients may result in
congested and sometimes unperfused liver parenchyma along the cut
surface \[8\]. Unperfused remnant liver parenchyma is to be avoided, not
only to reduce the risk of postoperative complications (bile leakage and
bleeding) but also not to worsen the long-term results \[9\]. An
imbalance of cytokines leading to a suppressed immunological status
eventually promoting tumor growth have been recently shown to affect
oncological outcomes in remnant liver ischemia after partial resections
for HCC.

an HCC in Sg8v-Sg4a involving the middle hepatic vein (MHV) close to the
hepatocaval confluence. The MHV has been clamped to assess the portal
flow. (a) CD-IOUS check of Sg4b glissonean pedicles (G4b). After MHV
clamping, the portal flow reverses and becomes hepatofugal, opposite to
the arterial hepatopetal (displayed in red) flow. Sg4b has therefore to
be resected. Sg5 (b, G5) and Sg8 ventral (c, G8v) glissonean branches
remain hepatopetal (displayed in red) after MHV clamping and will be
spared. (d) Based on the CD-IOUS findings, a Sg4 segmentectomy extended
to part of Sg8v has been performed. The anterior glissonean pedicle
(G5--8) is exposed on the cut surface, and the MHV, G4b and G8v stumps
are visible

13.4 Conclusion

The ultrasound liver-mapping technique enables planning and real-time
guidance during anatomical and non-anatomical liver resections. IOUS
allows the surgeon to follow the map inside the parenchyma thanks to the
continuous verification and correction of the surgical plane, thus
preventing damage to vascular structures that should be spared.

Hepatocellular carcinomaSurgical marginsAnatomical resectionsTumor
recurrence

14.1 Introduction

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the sixth most common malignant tumor
and the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide \[1\].
Depending on the patients' conditions and tumor status, surgical options
such as liver resection or transplantation represent the treatment of
choice as they offer long-term survival \[2, 3\]. Liver transplantation
is the best surgical option as it not only allows removal of the whole
tumor burden, but it also gives the opportunity to remove the diseased
liver, avoiding the carcinogenetic effect of cirrhosis \[4\].
Unfortunately, given the organ shortage, patients on the waiting list
have a 5% to 30% risk of progressing beyond the acceptable oncologic
criteria or they decompensate and never receive transplantation \[5\].
For this reason, liver resection is widely accepted as a valid curative
intent treatment offering a 5-year survival ranging between 40% and 70%,
depending on oncological-, patient- and liver-related prognostic factors
\[6, 7\].

Liver resection for HCC is widely adopted and standardized in many
specialized centers worldwide. Given the unique conditions upon which
HCC develops, liver resections in these patients require special
considerations. Indeed, HCC frequently occurs in patients with
underlying liver disease, negatively affecting the prognosis and
increasing the complexity of management \[8\]. In this setting, margins
during hepatectomies for HCC have been debated for many years and strong
evidence to support a standardized approach is currently lacking. In
this chapter, we will review the pathophysiology of HCC and try to
summarize the evidence on this debated topic.

14.2 Pathophysiology of Hepatocellular Carcinoma

The cytological features of HCC are unique in their form and differ from
any other malignancy. Pre-clinical studies have clarified that HCC has a
low incidence of lymph node metastasis and is not characterized by
lymphatic invasion, which is common among gastrointestinal malignancies.
Indeed, the rate of positive lymph nodes in patients undergoing liver
resection for HCC has been reported to be less than 2% \[9, 10\].
Conversely, HCC is associated with a high rate of capsular invasion,
vascular invasion, and intrahepatic metastasis in the form of satellite
nodules. One of the most important factors associated with capsular and
vascular invasion and with the genesis of intrahepatic metastasis is the
size of the tumor \[9, 10\]. Small HCCs initially tend to grow and
respect their capsule, while larger HCCs tend to first determine
vascular invasion and then seed in the adjacent parenchyma in the form
of satellite nodules. Interestingly, experimental studies have
previously shown that vascular invasion in HCC does not follow a common
pathway. In 1996, Mitsonobu et al. investigated the vascular pattern of
231 HCCs by injecting contrast into the tumor before the hepatectomy
\[11\]. Furthermore, they injected siliconized rubber after the
hepatectomy to create a cast of the tumor and the vascular pattern.
Besides providing beautiful imaging of the vascular architecture of HCC,
they demonstrated that its drainage pattern could be of two types: a
portal vein drainage pattern or a portal vein and hepatic vein drainage
pattern. The vast majority of HCCs on liver cirrhosis are drained by the
portal vein while HCC in healthy liver or in initial stage fibrosis show
a combination of portal vein and hepatic vein drainage. One of the
explanations for this vascular architecture is that liver cirrhosis
creates a mechanical obstacle to the natural drainage of the liver.
Indeed, given the thin and easily collapsible wall of sinusoids, the
blood drainage is inverted because of the occlusion of the small vessels
by the cirrhosis. This could also explain the natural hepatic vein
drainage of HCCs in healthy liver. These preclinical studies defined a
peculiar cytoarchitecture of HCC that is currently considered valid,
despite not having been studied in a prospective manner or in further
larger studies (Fig. 14.1). Cells of hepatocellular carcinoma are fed by
a peripheral branch of the hepatic artery allowing the tumor to receive
nutrients and therefore grow. Conversely, the portal vein acts as the
efferent vessel, draining blood from the tumor and sustaining the
metastatic process. Within the tumor itself, arterio-portal shunts are
invaded by HCC cells through a budding process and eventually enter the
portal system and seed in the nearby parenchyma, generating satellite
lesions.

Fig. 14.1Cytoarchitecture of hepatocellular carcinoma

14.3 Anatomical Resections for Hepatocellular Carcinoma

Almost 90% of HCCs grow in liver cirrhosis. Because cirrhotic livers are
compromised in function and regeneration, the margins during
hepatectomies need to be well planned to avoid postoperative
decompensation, while maintaining oncological goals \[12, 13\]. Because
of the cytoarchitecture and infiltration pathway, Makuuchi et al.
theorized that liver resections for HCC should be anatomical, removing
the whole tumor-bearing area vascularized by the serving portal pedicle
\[14\]. Indeed, given the portal venous drainage of HCCs, all the
territory fed by the same pedicle vascularizing the tumor could be
harboring micrometastatic disease and eventually lead to recurrence if
not removed. Following this principle, in Makuuchi's famous technique of
anatomical segmentectomies, after intraoperative ultrasound
identification of the portal pedicle feeding the tumor, the surgeon
injects methylene blue in the portal system. This allows depiction of
the area feeding the segment in which the tumor resides and complete
removal of the whole parenchyma, therefore respecting anatomical
principles. By these means, according to Makuuchi, you completely remove
the tumor and the micrometastatic disease, minimizing residual disease,
improving R0 resections and decreasing the rates of cancer recurrence.

14.4 Recurrence Following Surgery for Hepatocellular Carcinoma

Studies investigating surgical margins in HCC focus on the outcome of
recurrence, analyzing the crude number of patients experiencing
recurrence and reporting results among prognostic factors. However, the
history of this disease and its recurrence is more complex and
necessitates further considerations. HCC recurs in up to 70% of patients
following liver resections \[7\]. Tumor recurrence can be divided into
two different entities depending on the timing of occurrence. Previous
studies have shown that the natural history of HCC includes a first risk
of recurrence within 2 years, called early recurrence, and a second
occurrence after 2 years, the late recurrence \[9\]. These two different
patterns seem to be related to different mechanisms: for early
recurrence, the primary tumor itself which could have generated
micrometastatic disease early in the process; for late recurrence, the
cirrhosis which, because of its intrinsic carcinogenetic properties,
continues to generate aberrant clones of cells and therefore new tumors.
Poon et al. have demonstrated that early recurrence was associated with
the tumor's characteristics and with poor prognosis, while late
recurrence was associated with better prognosis and with cirrhosis
\[15\]. Further supporting this theory, a study focusing on clonality of
recurrence included five HCCs on a background of HBV-related cirrhosis
and analyzed the HBV DNA integration in both the primary tumor cells and
in the recurrence. Interestingly the authors found that two patients had
identical clonality between the primary tumor and the recurrence, while
three patients had completely different DNA integrations. This led to
the conclusion that HCC recurs with a "true recurrence" pattern and with
a "de-novo" pattern \[16\]. Given the complexity of the disease, studies
investigating the oncological outcomes of surgery should break down the
recurrence into two time frames ("early" and "late") and two patterns
("true" and "de-novo") to correctly assess oncological efficacy and
standardize terminology in the literature.

14.5 Surgical Margins for Hepatocellular Carcinoma

Patients with well-compensated liver function and no significant portal
hypertension represent the ideal surgical candidates. While the
international guidelines are clear on which patients should and should
not undergo resection, there is no clear indication on what type of
surgery should be performed and which surgical margins should be
respected. The only guideline that is somehow clearer is the European
Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) guideline, which states
that anatomical resections should be preferred in patients with HCCs of
at least 2 cm \[4\]. However, the same guideline concludes that this
statement should be interpreted with caution since the evidence comes
from retrospective studies with a high chance of selection bias. Indeed,
most of the studies comparing anatomical (AR) and non-anatomical
resections (non-AR) carry the bias of including more advanced patients
in terms of liver function in the AR group. Eguchi et al. reviewed the
Japanese HCC registry, reporting the outcomes of 5781 patients who
underwent resection \[17\]. A statistically significant association of
AR with survival and disease-free survival was shown. However, this
association was lost when stratifying patients according to the Liver
Damage score. A recent meta-analysis demonstrated more blood loss,
longer operative time, and wider margins in ARs compared to non-ARs, and
no differences in morbidity and mortality \[18\]. Furthermore, an
association with survival was shown and the authors concluded that
anatomical resections should be considered the treatment of choice in
patients undergoing resection for HCC. Unfortunately, this pooled
analysis carries significant selection bias, which limits its
conclusions. A significantly lower number of cirrhotic patients were
operated on in the AR group (53% vs. 66%; p \< 0.001), with fewer
Child-Pugh B patients (4.4% vs. 30.8%) and most of the preoperative
variables having an I2 \> 75%, including number of lesions, grading and
microvascular invasion, indicating a high heterogeneity between groups.

Evidence from randomized controlled trials comes into play in 2007: Shi
et al. randomized 173 patients with solitary HCCs on Child-Pugh A liver
function to undergo resection with a margin of 1 or 2 cm \[19\]. The
preoperative characteristics of patients were well balanced, and the
postoperative outcomes were not different. Five-year overall survival
was significantly better in the 2-cm margin group (74% vs. 49%; p =
0.008), as was the 5-year disease-free survival (52% vs. 40%; p = 0.04).
The number of patients developing recurrence was significantly lower in
the wide margin group, as was the number of recurrences at the
transection margin \[19\]. The reason for this association with survival
might be attributable to the treatment of recurrences, which was
potentially aimed at cure (using resection or ablation) in more patients
in the wide margin group. Although this study provides the first piece
of level 1 evidence, it answers the question of width of margin during
resection but not the question on whether resections should be
anatomical and respect the portal territory principle (Fig. 14.2). A
randomized controlled trial in 2017 tried to answer the question on AR
vs. non-AR. The authors randomized 105 patients with single HCCs in
Child-Pugh A cirrhosis, indocyanine green dye retention rate \<14%, and
no moderate or severe portal hypertension, to undergo AR or non-AR
\[20\]. No differences were found in the postoperative outcomes.
Furthermore, no differences in the oncological outcomes were found,
including overall survival and overall recurrence-free survival. The
only difference that was shown in this trial was in the primary outcome.
Indeed, AR showed a significantly better local recurrence-free survival
(p = 0.01) and a lower number of local recurrences within 2 years (30%
vs. 59%; p = 0.001). Furthermore, overall local recurrence was
significantly lower in the AR group (42% vs. 68%; p = 0.008) and median
time to recurrence was significantly longer (53 vs. 10 months; p \<
0.001). The results of this trial were later confirmed in a recent
meta-analysis of propensity score studies which showed no differences
between AR and non-AR in terms of overall survival, a significantly
better disease-free survival at 1 and 3 years following surgery in the
AR group and a comparable disease-free survival at 5 years \[21\].
Pooling together the results of the above-mentioned studies and the
evidence available so far, in patients with normal liver function,
single HCCs and adequate future liver remnant, anatomical resections
seem to provide better local control within 2 years from surgery, and
comparable long-term overall survival and disease-free survival.

14.6 Conclusions

HCC is a complex disease with peculiar cytoarchitecture and a high
chance of recurrence following treatment. Tumor recurrence should be
investigated and reported considering both its timing and pattern, to
correctly determine the prognosis of patients and manage the disease.
There is currently a lack of strong evidence to support narrow, wide, or
anatomical margins in patients undergoing surgical resection. Most of
the conclusions come from retrospective studies with a high chance of
selection bias. The only randomized controlled trials available to date
report a benefit in terms of local control within 2 years from surgery
for wide anatomical margins in patients with single HCC with preserved
liver function. Conversely, long-term overall and disease-free survival
are comparable. Future and larger studies are required to test the
results of the trials, incorporating advanced techniques addressing the
biology of the disease such as circulating tumor cells.

15.1 Introduction

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary liver tumor
and the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide \[1\].
When feasible, surgery represents the treatment of choice as it can
offer long-term survival \[2, 3\]. HCC frequently occurs in patients
with underlying liver disease, and this negatively affects prognosis and
increases the complexity of treatment \[4\]; liver cirrhosis in fact is
an independent prognostic factor for both short- and long-term outcomes,
and the assessment of liver function is critical in the management of
these patients as treatments may induce liver damage leading to
decompensation \[5\].

Despite the recent advances, a substantial proportion of patients still
presents with large and multinodular tumors, or lesions involving major
vascular structures. These patients bear a poor prognosis such that
international guidelines recommend a systemic approach to avoid the
perioperative risks of surgery \[6, 7\]. Despite this, some authors have
shown that radical resections in large or multinodular disease is
feasible and is associated with good long-term outcomes \[8--10\]. These
patients often require major hepatectomies to achieve radical resections
of their tumor burden \[11\]. Major hepatectomies for HCC require
special consideration as they are associated with increased
postoperative risks related to the background liver. In this setting,
careful preoperative selection of patients, discussion of treatment
options and adequate preparation for surgery are key to avoid
postoperative complications and offer long-term survivals. We herein
discuss the preoperative management, surgical and oncological outcomes
of major hepatectomies for HCC.

15.2 Preoperative Management

Major hepatectomies for HCC require careful preoperative patient
evaluation, especially when compromised liver function is suspected.
Specific biochemical and radiological investigations are necessary. Low
platelet number, high international normalized ratio (INR) values, a
positive history of variceal bleeding, encephalopathy, ascites, as well
as radiological findings of an enlarged spleen, cirrhotic liver, and
portosystemic shunts, should raise a suspicion of decreased liver
function and compromised portosystemic circulation. Liver function
impairment in these cases is estimated using well-known scores (i.e.,
the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease, and the Child-Turcotte-Pugh).
Then, the type of hepatectomy and the volume of liver to be removed is
balanced with the degree of liver function and the volume of the future
liver remnant (FLR), to assess the feasibility of the procedure.
Preoperative evaluation of the FLR is crucial to determine whether an
extended resection can be safely performed. In cases of cirrhotic liver,
an FLR of at least 40% should be maintained \[12\]. Moreover, liver
function is investigated using methods that estimate the regenerative
and functional capacity of the FLR, to avoid any potential risk of
post-hepatectomy liver failure (PHLF). Indeed, recent studies have
demonstrated that liver function is not necessarily related to liver
volume and that PHLF could occur even in sufficient liver volume.
Increasingly used in experienced hepatobiliary centers, these methods
are the indocyanine green dye retention test, the LiMAx test (using
13C-methacin), the monoethylglycinexylidide test, magnetic resonance
imaging with liver-specific contrast, and 99mTc-mebrofenin hepatobiliary
scintigraphy. These tests are used as a complementary method and provide
useful information on the FLR.

Most of the patients requiring major hepatectomies for HCC will have
insufficient or borderline volume and function to safely undergo a major
hepatectomy without the risk of PHLF. In this setting, preoperative
strategies to induce FLR hypertrophy have been described that aim to
increase the number of surgical candidates. Preoperative portal vein
embolization (PVE) was introduced more than 30 years ago by Makuuchi et
al. as a strategy to expand the indications for major hepatectomies in
borderline FLR \[13\]. By preoperatively shifting the portal blood flow,
PVE induces a volume and functional growth in 4--6 weeks, leading to a
better postoperative recovery without impairing the long-term results
\[14, 15\]. Furthermore, PVE can be combined with chemotherapy in what
is defined as transarterial chemoembolization (TACE): this combination
may strengthen the effect of PVE by embolizing the arterioportal shunts
in the tumor, simultaneously preventing progression thanks to the
chemotherapy \[16\]. Recently, the associating liver partition and
portal vein embolization for staged hepatectomy (ALPPS) procedure has
been described as an alternative to PVE for decreasing the risk of
drop-out during the interstage, by inducing a more rapid increase in FLR
\[17\]. Limited data are available on ALPPS for HCC and cirrhotic
livers: our group has previously reported good and safe perioperative
and oncological outcomes \[18\]. We currently reserve this procedure for
cases with large and advanced HCC with macrovascular invasion, when a
conventional two-stage approach is not feasible due to portal vein
branch invasion, when a previous PVE has failed or in bleeding tumors.
An interesting recent approach to large HCCs requiring major
hepatectomies in patients with limited FLR is radioembolization with
yttrium-90. This technique involves arterial embolization of the
affected liver to treat the tumor and induce contralateral hypertrophy.
A 42% increase in the size of the non-embolized liver has been reported
in cirrhosis \[19\]. Finally, a developing technique in this field is
liver venous deprivation, which allows for a rapid volume increase of
the FLR thanks to combined portal and hepatic vein embolization: the
results are promising but randomized trials are still ongoing. The
current management of patients with HCC requiring a major hepatectomy at
our department is summarized in Fig. 15.1.

15.3 Postoperative Outcomes of Major Hepatectomies for Hepatocellular
Carcinoma

Major hepatectomies for HCC are associated with significant operative
mortality and morbidity, especially when underlying liver cirrhosis is
present \[20, 21\]. PHLF and all the spectrum of associated conditions
are the most common scenarios. Indeed, the FLR is frequently not enough
to tolerate the changes in pressures following the removal of a major
portion of the liver, and the metabolic functions are significantly
reduced. As a result, patients have a prolonged postoperative stay,
which can lead to liver failure and eventually death. Therefore,
postoperative morbidity following major resections strictly depends on
patient selection, preoperative evaluation, and intra- and postoperative
management.

Overall, postoperative mortality ranges between 0--9% while morbidity
ranges between 10--60% \[22\]. With the improvement of perioperative
care and surgical techniques, zero hospital mortality rates can be
achieved in experienced hepatobiliary centers \[23, 24\]. The risk of
complications depends on the severity of the cirrhosis and increases
with impaired liver function. In a landmark study, the degree of
fibrosis strongly correlated with the development of postoperative
complications, especially liver failure, ascites and liver
decompensation \[20\]. Furthermore, while patients with Child-Pugh A
liver function well tolerate major hepatectomies, patients with
Child-Pugh B disease are at high risk of postoperative events. Recently,
we have shown that patients with Child-Pugh B liver function undergoing
major hepatectomies had a high mortality (10.3%) and morbidity rate
(69.2%), a high rate of major complications (46.1%) and frequently
developed ascites (61.5%) and PHLF (10.2%) \[25\]. Therefore, in the
setting of advanced liver cirrhosis and large or multinodular HCCs
requiring major hepatectomies, extreme caution is necessary: patients
must be carefully selected and potential alternatives evaluated to
reduce the chance of postoperative morbidity and mortality.

The technical aspects of major hepatectomies themselves can impact
postoperative outcomes. The so-called "anterior approach" is a technical
modification during right hepatectomy that was first described by Ozawa
in 1990: in this variant, mobilization of the right liver from the
diaphragm is left as a last step, after parenchymal transection \[26\].
In a randomized controlled trial, Liu et al. demonstrated that the
anterior approach was associated with less blood loss and fewer patients
requiring blood transfusions \[21\]. In this study, although the
difference was not statistically significant, the anterior approach
group had lower rates of PHLF (1.7% vs. 10%; p = 0.114). This could be
attributed to the lack of extensive manipulation maintaining
physiological circulation throughout the procedure. In 2001, Belghiti et
al. first described a safe approach to right hepatectomies without liver
mobilization using the "hanging maneuver": this guides the transection
of the parenchyma and reduces intraoperative bleeding \[27\]. In our
institution, right hepatectomies are performed in a standardized fashion
using the anterior approach with the hanging maneuver, the intrafascial
approach to the hilar structure, ultrasonic transection and bipolar
coagulation of the parenchyma, intraparenchymal stapling of the bile
duct and right hepatic vein, and liver mobilization at the end of the
procedure.

15.4 Oncological Outcomes of Major Hepatectomies for Hepatocellular
Carcinoma

According to major international guidelines, resection for HCC is
restricted to early-stage disease with preserved liver function \[6,
7\]. Despite this, studies from different countries have shown that
resections for single large and multinodular HCC are associated with low
mortality rates and favorable long-term prognosis \[8--10\].
Furthermore, one randomized controlled trial and one meta-analysis
demonstrated that, despite recurrence remaining an issue, resection is
associated with improved long-term outcomes as compared to locoregional
therapies \[22, 28\]. Pooling the results from these studies led to a
consensus that surgery should at least be considered a therapeutic
option in patients with single large or multinodular disease requiring
major hepatectomy.

Overall, the 5-year survival of patients with single large or
multinodular hepatocellular carcinoma undergoing resection ranges
between 20--70%, while the 5-year disease free survival ranges between
10--50% \[22\]. The long-term outcomes of major surgeries in these
scenarios are promising and resections are currently routine practice in
many experienced centers worldwide.

International guidelines recommend locoregional treatments in patients
with multinodular or single large HCC. However, the long-term data
should be carefully evaluated and compared to available options and the
locoregional complications should not be underestimated. In a
meta-analysis by Marelli et al., TACE was associated with a 2.4%
mortality rate, with other studies demonstrating inferior oncological
outcomes as compared to resections \[22, 28\]. Specifically, a
randomized controlled trial involving 173 patients with resectable
multiple HCC beyond the Milan criteria revealed that resection was
associated with significantly better overall survival than TACE (p \<
0.001) \[28\]. Tumor size or number does not influence the patients'
long-term survival rates, although more complex surgical techniques are
required \[29, 30\].

It should be mentioned that most studies on long-term outcomes are from
Asia where patients mostly present with HCC on the background of
hepatitis B-related liver cirrhosis. In Western countries, hepatitis
C-related disease and HCCs are more common, followed by alcoholic
hepatitis and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: recurrences and
survivals should be investigated in these settings.

15.5 Laparoscopic Major Hepatectomies for Hepatocellular Carcinoma

Despite the initial controversies, laparoscopy is now accepted as an
effective alternative in the treatment of liver malignancies, with more
than 10,000 cases reported \[31\]. Laparoscopic liver resections (LLRs)
in the treatment of HCC have been widely reported with good short-term
results and safe oncological outcomes. LLRs may help reduce the risk of
PHLF by respecting the collateral portosystemic shunts, avoiding major
liver mobilization, and avoiding electrolyte imbalances \[25\]. Despite
this, most of the series available describe the results of minor
hepatectomies in highly selected patients. Major hepatectomies in the
setting of liver cirrhosis are challenging procedures that need to be
performed in a safe environment, especially if done laparoscopically. In
a recent study comparing open and laparoscopic major hepatectomies for
HCC, laparoscopy was associated with less blood loss. Furthermore,
postoperative morbidity was significantly lower, and hospital stay
shorter. R0 resection rates were similar and long-term outcomes were
comparable between groups \[32\]. The only disadvantage reported in most
of the studies was that LLRs were associated with an increase in
operative time, which is probably related to a learning curve effect.
Nonetheless, there is a non-negligible risk of conversion to open
surgery, which is higher than in minor resections and in resections for
colorectal cancer liver metastases. The main reasons for conversions are
bleeding and oncological. Indeed, the lack of tactile sensation and the
challenges in performing ultrasound result in conversion rates of major
hepatectomy for HCC ranging between 10--20% \[33, 34\].

15.6 Conclusions

Major hepatectomies represent a valid therapeutic option for patients
with large and multinodular HCCs. Postoperative and oncological results
are safe when appropriate evaluation and preparation of patients is
carried out. Laparoscopic major hepatectomies are increasingly performed
in experienced centers and should be further investigated as a good
technical alternative with better postoperative results and comparable
oncological outcomes.

surgery

16.1 Introduction

Apart from liver transplantation, which remains the standard of care for
selected patients, locoregional therapies, such as hepatic resection,
percutaneous ablations, and transarterial treatments, are also
considered with curative intent for patients affected by hepatocellular
carcinoma (HCC) \[1, 2\]. However, these locoregional therapies are
associated with high rates of disease recurrence, up to 60% at 3 years
\[3, 4\], which are usually thought to be counteracted by performing
anatomic resection (AR) with negative surgical margins (R0-hepatectomy)
\[5--7\]. However, in the surgical community some confusion exists about
these technical concepts, specifically about their definitions, their
practical application and, importantly, about their prognostic
significance. In this chapter, we review the concepts of tumor exposure,
AR, and surgical margins in HCC patients and present objective data and
considerations supporting our strategy of minimizing liver sacrifice
while maximizing the chance of cure, which led to the introduction and
performance of R1-vascular hepatectomy, or vessel-guided liver surgery
\[8\], as a standard of care in liver surgery.

16.2 Anatomic Resection: Forty Years of Studies

Starting in the late 70s, Makuuchi et al. illustrated the surgical
technique of anatomical parenchymal-sparing hepatectomy for HCC. The
technique was later reported in 1985 and has become a keystone in liver
surgery \[5\]. For the purposes of this chapter, some points need to be
borne in mind. First, the performance of AR is a technically demanding
procedure that requires deep knowledge of liver anatomy; unfortunately,
many of the published papers on this topic are flawed because they lack
those important surgical technical details that make the message
understandable and generalizable. Second, without the use of
intraoperative ultrasound (IOUS) the performance of parenchymal-sparing
AR is impossible except for major resections, such as right and left
hepatectomy. As stated, many of the published papers on this topic lack
a description of the surgical technique adopted to perform AR. Third,
performance of AR does not depend on the achievement of negative
margins. Indeed, complete removal of microsatellites depends on the
complete removal of the tumor-containing part, i.e., the entire vascular
bed supplying the lesion. However, the removal of an entire hepatic
segment does not ensure prevention of tumor exposure. In the case of an
HCC located in segment 8 that is in contact with the right and middle
hepatic veins at the caval confluence, a full AR of segment 8 will
expose the right and middle hepatic veins on the cut surface; the
specimen at the level of the detached site of contact between the HCC
and the hepatic veins should have exposed the tumoral surface. At that
site, the risk of microsatellites is nil, and consequently the risk of
local recurrence becomes negligible if an adequate technique is
meticulously applied under IOUS guidance \[9, 10\]. However, sparing of
the vessel by means of tumor--vein detachment minimizes the excision of
liver parenchyma, which is important since the prognosis of HCC patients
depends much more on the residual liver volume than on the width of the
surgical margin \[11\]. Thus, any new lesion occurring in the adjacent
segments during the follow-up should not be considered an undetected
satellite not removed during surgery, but rather a distant metastasis
that would have not been prevented by a wider surgical margin. Fourth,
many factors other than margin status play a role in determining local
and systemic recurrence of HCC after hepatectomy. Among them are tumor
number, tumor size, tumor grading, tumor vascular invasion, as well as
factors related to the underlying liver disease that drive the
development of new HCCs or at any rate impact survival. Considering
these factors, the prognostic significance of true AR might be secondary
so that in some cases of advanced tumoral presentations the performance
of IOUS-guided non-AR could be also considered adequate.

16.3 To Expose or Not to Expose the Tumor on Cut Surface?

The effect of surgical margin status on the survival of patients with
HCC has been studied, but controversies persist among surgeons. In the
last two decades several literature reviews have studied the effect of
the surgical margin in surgery for HCC, with the specific aim of
supporting or not supporting the use of no-margin surgery for HCC
patients (see Table 16.1 and online supplementary material). Among 23
studies (years 1999--2021), 6 were in favor of tumor exposure while 10
were explicitly in favor of a large (centimeter) margin. All these
studies were retrospective except for a randomized clinical trial by Shi
et al. \[7\] and a prospective trial by Donadon et al. \[12\]. Shi et
al. compared HCC patients with 1-cm margin versus those with 2-cm margin
and observed a lower recurrence rate in the wide-margin group and very
high rates of local recurrence (29%) in the narrow-margin group.
However, such a high rate of local recurrence is inconsistent with other
larger series, and the associated unclear description of AR and non-AR
remains the major flaw of that study. Conversely, the study from Donadon
et al. \[12\] was in line with the longstanding literature coming from
Japan which clearly reports the surgical technical details that are
important to make the message understandable and generalizable;
moreover, the study endpoint was set exactly on the topic of tumor
exposure which, consistent with previous literature, was considered
indicated only in cases of detachment from major vascular structures
intended to be preserved to preserve the liver parenchyma.Table

Such controversies in surgical margin for HCC have important practical
and clinical implications in terms of patient selection and therapeutic
planning. Indeed, as a result of these different publications and their
authors' surgical strategies, there are disparate definitions of
resectability for HCC, which lead to disparate therapeutic indications
and consequently to the flourish of HCC classifications and therapeutic
flowcharts \[13\].

When discussing surgical margin status it is important to define the
relationship between the width of the tumor-free margin and the size of
the tumor. The risk of satellites increases with tumor size \[14\], thus
a clear margin should be achieved in the case of tumors larger than 2.5
cm. These findings are consistent with the observation that in HCCs
smaller than 2 cm similar local control can be achieved using either the
ablation technique or hepatic resection \[15\]. However, this should not
act as a confounding finding when attention is focused on 0-mm margins
at the site of contact between the tumor and a major vessel, whether a
glissonean pedicle or a hepatic vein. In such cases, tumor exposure on
the cut surface, even when the HCC is larger than 2.5 cm, should be
considered acceptable. Indeed, the possibility of leaving some tumor
tissues at that site is negligible as long as the surgery is performed
under IOUS guidance \[9, 10\]. Conversely, sacrificing the vessels could
result in major parenchymal removal and increased surgical risk \[16,
17\] without the counterbalance of improving the long-term outcomes.
Indeed, in HCC patients the curability of the tumor should always be
balanced against the risk of postoperative liver dysfunction. These
concepts are the foundation of our technical protocol that in 2005 we
named "radical but conservative surgery" for liver tumors, whose primary
model, among the different liver tumors, was precisely HCC \[9\]. Since
then, we developed the concept of tumor detachment from major
intrahepatic vascular structures---the so-called R1-vascular
hepatectomy---aiming to improve resectability of the tumor and decrease
its invasiveness on the liver, which is often diseased. More recently,
we were able to report how this technical protocol was associated with
good oncological outcomes \[12\].

Therefore, while a given hepatectomy with anticipated narrow or 0-mm
margin should not be denied a priori, the appropriateness of detaching a
given HCC from an intrahepatic vascular structure might be just a
reflection of a better tumor biology. Yet, the outcome of a tumor that
grows along a major vascular structure may differ depending on whether
it has an expansive or invasive growing pattern. However, most HCCs have
a typical pseudo-capsule that allows safe separation of the tumor from
the underlying liver without affecting long-term survival. Of note, this
pseudo-capsule is the result of the host's immune response against tumor
cells and represents the natural margin of separation between the
tumoral and non-tumoral tissues \[18--22\]. Moreover, while tumor
clearance at the resection margin may be helpful in preventing local
recurrence, if we consider that most intrahepatic recurrences originate
from either portal venous dissemination \[23, 24\] or multicentric
carcinogenesis \[25, 26\], it is clear that a wide resection margin may
not have a significant impact on the risk of HCC recurrence. These
considerations provide a strong background for parenchymal-sparing
procedures and conservative treatments of patients with HCC. When a
limited functional liver reserve is anticipated, a major or extended
liver resection for the sole purpose of achieving large negative margins
is not justifiable. Additionally, considering that patients with
diseased liver have a high incidence of intrahepatic recurrence in the
liver remnant, the strategy of leaving sufficient functional liver
parenchyma---both to reduce operative morbidity and mortality and to
allow for new locoregional treatments---should be the roadmap in surgery
for HCC.

16.4 R1-Vascular Surgery Is the Roadmap for Parenchymal-Sparing
Hepatectomy

As stated above, when an HCC is in contact with the veins, it can be
removed anatomically, although exposed on the cut surface. In other
words, performing an anatomic resection in HCC does not depend on
achieving negative margins \[27\] (Figs. 16.1 and 16.2).

vein and the stump of G8 (g). The surgical specimen is also shown (h, i)

The enormous developments in IOUS over the last two decades are the
backbone of modern parenchymal-sparing surgery. Indeed, thanks to IOUS
guidance, deeply located tumors may be approached by following complex
multiplanar dissection trajectories \[27--30\], resulting in an
opportunity to perform radical surgery while preserving functional
non-tumoral parenchyma. These complex approaches are mainly possible by
using two techniques. The first consists of detaching the tumors from
major intrahepatic vessels whenever IOUS excludes infiltration, that is,
R1-vascular hepatectomy. The second involves identifying and using
communicating vessels among the main hepatic veins: once detected and
preserved, these communicating vessels could guarantee adequate outflow
to liver parenchyma even after a main hepatic vein resection \[27--30\].
The combination of these techniques has led to the possibility of
performing several new types of liver resections as an alternative to
standard major hepatectomies \[31--35\].

16.5 Conclusions

In HCC patients, curability of the tumor should be balanced against the
risk of postoperative liver dysfunction. Thanks to the use of modern
real-time IOUS guidance it is possible to perform complex radical but
conservative hepatectomies, for which R1-vascular surgery represents the
technical roadmap for parenchymal-sparing hepatectomies.

Hepatocellular carcinomaLiver resectionAssociating liver partition and
portal vein ligationALPPSPortal vein occlusionMacrovascular
invasionPost-hepatectomy liver failure

17.1 Introduction

Associating liver partition and portal vein ligation for staged
hepatectomy (ALPPS) is considered one of the main recent innovations in
liver cancer surgery. This procedure is a modification of the
traditional two-stage hepatectomy which involves in-situ splitting of
the liver along the main portal fissure or on the right side of the
falciform ligament in association with portal vein ligation to induce
rapid hypertrophy of the left future liver remnant (FLR) in patients
with non-resectable primary or metastatic liver tumors. The first step
is followed by an early (i.e., 7 days) second step in which, after the
left FLR has been hypertrophied, resection of the tumor is performed by
resection of the contralateral atrophied lobe \[1, 2\]. The main
limiting factor of hepatic resection for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)
associated with liver cirrhosis is FLR volume. In order to maintain
sufficient liver function and avoid small-for-size syndrome or death due
to liver failure, it is highly recommended, in cases of underlying liver
disease, that the FLR should be 40% of the total liver volume \[3, 4\].
The gold standard technique to increase the FLR is portal vein occlusion
(PVO) with surgical ligation or embolization allowing a hypertrophy rate
of 35--70% in 45 days \[5, 6\]. The drawbacks of PVO are a high rate of
interstage dropout for tumoral progression, inability to perform the
procedure in the presence of portal vein tumor or hepatic vein
thrombosis, and inadequate FLR in cirrhotic liver. It is well known that
a liver with an underlying disease has a lower regenerative and
hypertrophying capacity. Our initial experience shows that the ALLPS
procedure is technically feasible and safe even in cirrhotic patients
for the treatment of HCC with major liver resections and can induce a
significant increase of the FLR in a short period of time \[7, 8\]. In
2019, Chan et al. reported on 148 patients with HCC who underwent FLR
modulation (ALPPS, n = 46; PVO: n = 102). ALPPS still induced a greater
FLR hypertrophy than PVO. The percentage of FLR volume gain was more
pronounced in chronic hepatitis than in cirrhosis (52.7% vs. 32.5%), but
the speed of liver regeneration, as expressed by the daily rate of
hypertrophy (24.6 vs. 20.7 mL/day), showed no significant difference
\[9\]. Right portal vein ligation in stage I increases portal pressure
and portal flow in the FLR by almost threefold, while the addition of
parenchymal transection does not further increase the hemodynamic
changes. Indeed, the effect of parenchymal splitting is predominantly
the release of liver growth factors rather than a flow issue. At the
same time, the hemodynamic changes induced by portal vein ligation
enhance the effect of these growth factors, resulting in rapid liver
regeneration \[10\]. Therefore, the ALPPS procedure has been shown to
effectively increase the resectability of otherwise inoperable advanced
HCC by achieving a rapid and effective hypertrophy of the FLR, also in
cirrhotic livers, and overcoming the traditional drawbacks of PVO.

17.2 Indications for ALPPS

The ALPPS procedure is reserved for patients with HCC in cirrhotic liver
for the following conditions: (1) conventional PVO is not feasible due
to portal branch invasion; (2) a previous PVO has failed to achieve the
FLR necessary to safely undergo a major hepatic resection; (3) hepatic
vein tumor thrombosis with a risk of rapid progression into the inferior
vena cava and atrium; (4) aggressive tumor in which the classical
two-step strategy cannot be applied owing to the risk of hepatic tumor
progression between the two steps; (5) neoplastic biliary thrombus
associated with biliary dilatation and jaundice; (6) emergency resection
for large bleeding tumors (Fig. 17.1). These conditions fall within
Barcelona Clinic for Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage C (advanced stage)
\[11\]. Tumoral macrovascular invasion (MVI) is common in the natural
history of HCC. It affects 10--40% of patients and is defined as
infiltration/thrombosis of the supra-hepatic veins (SHVT), inferior vena
cava (ICVT), or portal branches (PVTT). Biliary involvement is less
common. Several types of MVI are described, but portal vein tumor
thrombosis seems to be more frequent than hepatic vein tumor thrombosis
\[12\]. Kokudo et al. recently reported a survival up to 3.95 years for
hepatic resection in the case of major vein involvement with inferior
vena cava sparing and also for PVTT \[13\]. The management of HCC with
MVI remains quite challenging and patients should be carefully evaluated
and selected in order to avoid post-hepatectomy liver failure (PHLF)
\[14, 15\]. In this setting, ALPPS represents a valid surgical
alternative for advanced HCC, especially in cases with MVI.

Fig. 17.1Indications for ALPPS in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma

17.3 Technical Aspects

During step 1, resectability is confirmed by intraoperative ultrasound,
checking the tumor's extension in the FLR. The left lobe is fully
mobilized. The hepatoduodenal ligament is dissected from the right side
and the right portal vein is ligated; the right hepatic artery is
encircled with a vessel loop. The arteries, bile ducts and hepatic veins
are preserved \[16\]. To minimize the impact of the first stage and
allow for a rapid recovery of the patient, we modified our technique by
introducing a partial liver transection (p-ALPPS) and minimal
mobilization of the right liver using the hanging maneuver (HM) \[17\].
Studies have shown that p-ALPPS is comparable to total parenchymal
transection up to the inferior vena cava in terms of hypertrophy of the
FLR \[18\]. In our experience, a partial split results in fewer
complications related to the transection surface, such as bile leaks and
bleeding, as well as reducing surgical time and transfusions. The use of
the HM with the anterior approach during ALPPS makes it possible to
avoid tumor manipulation, to minimize the right liver mobilization and
to facilitate the full transection of the two hemi-livers down the
anterior wall of the inferior vena cava during step 2. Furthermore, it
might reduce intraoperative blood loss, operative time and potentially
reduce postoperative morbidity \[19\]. In our experience, we avoid using
plastic bags and hemostatic agents and we prefer to place a peritoneal
patch retrieved from the gallbladder or the whole gallbladder after
dissecting it from the liver in order to reduce the adhesions between
the two surfaces and ensure easier access to the two hemi-livers during
the second step \[20, 21\]. The tape and the right hepatic artery loop
can be externalized for the second step. During ALPPS step 2, the right
hepatic artery, right bile duct and right hepatic vein are ligated and
sectioned. The diseased liver is detached from the diaphragm and
retroperitoneum and removed from the abdominal cavity using an anterior
approach \[16\]. We avoid using staplers for the transection of the
hepatic artery and bile duct because of the high risk of biliary
stenosis \[22\]. Liver function between stages is crucial for the
success of this novel and complex procedure. Stage-1 ALPPS might be
regarded as a liver function "stress test", with patients who develop
liver failure after stage 1 not being suitable candidates to proceed
with stage 2 \[23\]. During the first ALPPS Consensus Meeting held in
Hamburg in February 2015, it was stated that step 2 should be completed
following the already accepted volumetric standards used for major
hepatectomies \[1\]. Nevertheless, the reported incidence of PHLF in the
International Registry ranged from 16% to 31% even when sufficient FLR
volumes had been achieved \[24\]. The rapid volumetric increase during
ALPPS may not be paired with functional increase, as recently suggested
by histologic hepatocyte immaturity in the FLR parenchyma and volume
overestimating function in 60% of patients \[25\]. Serenari et al. in
2017 investigated the value of interstage SPECT-HBS (hepatobiliary
scintigraphy using 99mTc-mebrofenin with single photon emission computed
tomography) in predicting the risk of PHLF after ALPPS step 2, finding a
HIBA index of \<15% to best predict clinically significant PHLF in
patients with an already sufficient FLR volume \[26\].

17.4 Outcomes

HCC is associated with a 5-year overall survival (OS) ranging from 50%
to 70% in the case of early stage disease and when curative treatments
such as liver resection, liver transplantation and ablation are
feasible. In advanced stages, OS drops to 10--15% \[27, 28\]. Patients
with cancer-related symptoms (bleeding tumor, caval compression,
respiratory distress), MVI (either segmental or portal invasion) or
extrahepatic disease bear a poor prognosis with expected survival times
of 6--8 months and are candidates for systemic treatment according to
the guidelines of the European and American associations for the study
of liver diseases (EASL and AASLD) \[29\]. The indications for resection
in patients with cirrhosis should be based on liver function and
performance status, the presence of portal hypertension, the extent of
hepatectomy and the expected volume of the FLR, bearing in mind that the
perioperative mortality of liver resection in cirrhotic patients should
be less than 3% \[30\]. Surgery for HCC in cirrhosis represents a
challenge: a detailed preoperative evaluation, choosing the appropriate
operative approach and surgical maneuver to minimize PHLF and
intraoperative bleeding, followed by careful postoperative management,
are necessary for a safe liver resection in cirrhotic liver \[31\]. Up
to now, most studies have focused on the indications, the technical
aspects, and the feasibility of the procedure, highlighting the high
morbidity and mortality rates. The initially reported mortality of 12%
triggered an intense debate about the safety of this procedure, limiting
its promotion worldwide \[2\]. Schadde et al. in 2015 showed a
complication rate of 59--64% and a postoperative mortality rate ranging
between 12% and 16% in a study with 320 ALPPS, 10% of which were HCC
\[24\]. D'Haese et al. in 2015 compared 35 ALPPS for HCC with 225 ALPPS
for colorectal liver metastases (CRLM), including all patients
registered in the international ALPPS Registry from 2010 to 2015. The
90-day mortality rate was significantly higher for patients with HCC
(31%) than for the patients with CRLM (7%), whereas the incidence of
severe complications did not differ significantly between the two groups
(62.9% and 56.8% for HCC and CRLM, respectively). However, liver failure
according to the 50/50 criteria occurred in HCC for twice as many
patients compared with CRLM (40% vs. 19%). Finally, the study showed a
significantly shorter overall survival for HCC patients after ALPPS. The
high perioperative mortality after ALPPS for HCC seems to be the main
reason for impaired overall survival \[32\]. Morbidity and mortality are
not the main issue of the ALPPS procedure since it is mostly performed
in extreme situations. Increased occurrence of adverse events can be
justified by unfavorable conditions such as cirrhosis, bleeding tumors,
huge nodules with caval compression, MVI with PVTT, hepatic and caval
vein thrombosis, and biliary spread. In these high-risk situations,
ALPPS can be considered the only surgical option to obtain a rapid
increase of the FLR, allowing a complete resection \[33, 34\]. Chan et
al. showed that ALPPS improved the resection rate in hepatitis-related
HCC with a comparable safety profile with PVO and, more importantly, the
long-term survival in ALPPS was comparable with that of PVO regardless
of tumor stage and without difference in recurrence rate. However, in
this study only 45.7% of the ALPPS were performed on cirrhosis and no
patients had MVI \[9\]. In 2018 we reported the outcome of 17 ALPPS for
HCC of which 8 with vascular involvement, highlighting a 90-day
mortality of 5.8% and a 2-year OS of 38.5% with a median follow-up of 10
months. Recently, we investigated the outcome of 28 patients (85.7%
cirrhotic patients) with HCC and MVI undergoing the ALPPS procedure in
our center. MVI of the hepatic veins or inferior vena cava was diagnosed
in 46.4% of patients while portal vein involvement was present in 64.2%
of cases, and four patients (14.2%) were diagnosed with bile duct
involvement. No patients died after step 1 while complications occurred
in 21.4% of cases. Following step 2, 3 patients (11.5%) died and 20
(69.2%) developed complications. Grade B and C post-hepatectomy liver
failure occurred in 57.6% and 11.5% of patients, respectively. After a
median follow-up of 18 months (7--35), median survival was 22 months
(3--40). Eleven patients (39.3%) recurred. Median disease-free survival
was 15 months (5--26) \[35\]. The prognosis of HCC with vascular
invasion is very poor and the guidelines recommend medical treatment
with sorafenib, with a median survival of 8--10 months and a poor
quality of life. Aggressive surgical treatment in the case of PVTT and
SHVT yields an acceptable long-term outcome, which has shown to be
better than unresectable HCC treated with sorafenib (47.4 vs. 10.7
months) \[36, 37\]. Kokudo et al. reported the results of surgery in a
cohort of 2000 HCC with MVI of the portal vein showing survival times up
to 2.67 years \[13\]. A French survey reviewed retrospectively 143 HCC
with MVI of which 70% with portal thrombosis, showing a 90-day mortality
of 16% and an OS similar to that achieved with sorafenib \[36\]. The
ALPPS procedure is an aggressive surgical procedure and not all patients
are suitable. Patients should be carefully selected and can undergo
major hepatic surgery only if they are Child-Pugh stage A without portal
hypertension. Over the years we have learned that ALPPS should be
reserved for extreme situations such as: conventional two-stage
hepatectomy not feasible due to portal vein branch invasion; failure of
PVO to increase the FLR; SHVT and/or PVTT with a risk of rapid
progression into the cava-atrium and main trunk; huge and/or bleeding
tumor where the classical two-stage hepatectomy cannot be applied owing
to the risk of tumor progression and/or rupture. Serenari et al.
compared minimally invasive (MI-ALPPS) with the standard open approach
in a study cohort of 66 patients enrolled in the ALPPS Italian Registry.
Major morbidity after MI-ALPPS was 8.3% compared with 28.6% reported
after open ALPPS, but selection bias was present, such as a low rate of
cirrhotic livers in MI-ALPPS (25% vs. 68.9%) \[38\]. Several studies in
patients with HCC treated with sorafenib reported an OS of 15.6--20.1
months for BCLC-B and of 8.4--13.6 months for BCLC-C \[39, 40\].

17.5 Conclusions

The ALPPS procedure is a feasible approach for advanced HCC in the
cirrhotic with small FLR and/or MVI with acceptable OS and disease-free
survival, compared with patients treated with medical treatment, as
shown by the current guidelines. ALPPS should therefore be included in
the management algorithm for FLR modulation in HCC patients.

18.1 Introduction

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fourth most common cause of
cancer-related death worldwide. Tumor recurrence mainly accounts for
reduced long-term survival. The 5-year recurrence rate following primary
resection ranges from 40 to 70%, and up to 95% of recurrences are
intrahepatic \[1, 2\]. Therefore, a strict radiological follow-up is
essential to identify early-stage recurrences amenable to a second
curative intended treatment. Several treatment options may be
considered, which include repeat hepatectomy (RH), salvage liver
transplant (SLT), and radiofrequency ablation (RFA). The best treatment
option for recurrent HCC is currently debated, and selection criteria
may vary between centers. Although there are recognized international
guidelines for the management of primary HCC, similar guidelines still
need to be implemented for recurrent HCC (Table 18.1) \[3--6\].Table

18.2 Types and Mechanisms of Hepatocellular Carcinoma Recurrence

Intrahepatic recurrences are ascribed to two distinct mechanisms. The
first is de novo carcinogenesis in the remaining liver, which results in
multicentric occurrence (MO). However, most recurrences are due to
intrahepatic metastases (IM) originating from the same cell lineage of
the primary cancer \[3\]. According to recent research, IM seems to be
driven by either local dissemination of the tumor through the portal
blood flow (local IM) or by systemic dissemination of tumor cells, which
may rehome themselves in the liver (systemic IM). The latter mechanism
could explain HCC recurrence even after liver transplantation \[7\].
Patients with MO have shown improved long-term survival following both
primary hepatectomy and re-treatment compared to those with IM \[8, 9\].
Thus, determining the recurrent type could potentially lead to
individualized treatment approaches in the future. Evidence exists that
time to recurrence could help distinguish between recurrent types. Poon
et al. have found that early recurrences arose mainly from IM, while
late recurrences were likely to originate from MO \[10\]. Therefore, a
cut-off of 2 years has been adopted to grossly classify early and late
recurrences. Liquid biopsy and characterization of genetic differences
may help distinguish between the different recurrent types more
accurately \[9\]. However, these methods are not yet part of current
clinical practice.

18.3 Repeat Hepatectomy or Salvage Liver Transplant?

In 2000, Majno et al. first reported the use of SLT (i.e., primary
resection with curative intent, followed by transplantation in cases of
tumor recurrence) with acceptable outcomes \[11\]. Different studies
have subsequently recognized SLT as an effective treatment option, with
overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) comparable with
those after primary liver transplantation (LT) in selected patients. In
a recent meta-analysis, Wang et al. have demonstrated that SLT provided
comparable OS and 1-year DFS rates to RH, although it was superior in
terms of 3- and 5-year DFS \[12\]. Similar data were reported by another
meta-analysis, which confirmed that SLT led to a longer DFS but was
burdened by higher postoperative morbidity and comparable mortality to
RH \[13\].

If there is no other choice but SLT in cases of HCC recurrence along
with deteriorated liver function, the recurrence of resectable HCC in
livers with preserved function still leads to a treatment dilemma
between RH and SLT (Table 18.2). In this context, RH is the preferable
treatment option in the case of late intrahepatic HCC recurrence, with
preserved hepatic function \[3\]. However, Yoon et al. have recently
found that SLT is superior to RH even in patients with Child-Pugh class
A \[14\].Table 18.2Advantages and disadvantages of repeat hepatectomy

Nevertheless, organ shortages and patients' non-suitability due to
advanced age and acquired comorbidities impair the widespread use of
SLT. Moreover, some tumor recurrences are not compatible with the SLT
eligibility criteria \[15\]. There is, however, a substantial difference
in the accessibility to SLT among countries with different resource
levels \[2\]. The short supply of deceased organs in Eastern countries
makes this option possible only if a living donor is available. The
situation is quite different for Western countries, where allocation
systems currently assure a high priority on the transplant waiting list
in the case of early recurrence after first-line treatment \[3, 16\].

18.4 Repeat Hepatectomy Versus Other Treatments

RFA remains an alternative for the radical treatment of HCC recurrence,
considering the hepatic functional reserve and percutaneous
accessibility of the nodule \[3\]. A recent analysis of a multicenter
Italian registry has shown that RH and RFA were performed in 16.3% and
16.6% of patients with recurrent HCC, respectively \[17\]. Two recent
meta-analyses were not able to demonstrate a clear superiority of either
RH or RFA for recurrent HCC in terms of OS and DFS \[1, 18\].
Nevertheless, in a propensity score-matched analysis, Chua et al. have
found that RH, despite a higher morbidity rate, allows a better local
disease control and confers a late survival benefit \[19\]. One possible
explanation is that RH is more likely to resect undetectable distant
micro-lesions, which are more frequent in recurrent HCC and account for
its higher subsequent recurrence rate compared to primary tumors.

Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is frequently used to treat HCC
recurrence after resection and, in a recent study, it was reported to
provide similar results to RH \[1\]. However, several other studies have
undoubtedly demonstrated that a new radical treatment for recurrent HCC
should be assured whenever possible \[2, 20\].

18.5 Repeated Repeat Hepatectomy

Few studies have reported positive outcomes following more than two
hepatectomies. Itamoto et al. showed that the more times an RH was
performed, the shorter the recurrence-free interval became \[21\]. Wu et
al. reported that a fourth hepatectomy was not more beneficial than
other treatments for third recurrences of HCC \[22\]. More recently,
Yamashita et al. have shown that a third or more hepatectomy could be
performed safely in very selected cases with a relatively maintained OS,
although 5-year DFS remained significantly lower compared to first and
second resection \[23\]. Nevertheless, the main limitation of this
approach remains the low percentage of suitable patients. If
approximately 15--30% of patients with recurrent HCC are eligible for a
second hepatectomy, even fewer are for a third or more hepatectomy
\[24\].

18.6 Predictors of Recurrence After Repeat Hepatectomy

A 5-year DFS of 10--17% after RH highlights the critical need for proper
preoperative risk stratification to avoid futile resections. The main
reported predictors of poor survival after RH include time to recurrence
of \<1 year, tumor number (\>1 nodule) and size (\>5 cm), micro- and
macrovascular invasion, and poor differentiation \[24, 25\]. As numerous
studies have identified the utility of elevated alpha-fetoprotein levels
in predicting HCC recurrence after primary resection, other researchers
have investigated its prognostic role after RH. However, a high
heterogeneity exists between these studies, with variable cut-off values
ranging between 20--400 ng/mL \[26, 27\]. The platelet-to-lymphocyte
ratio was more recently found to be an independent risk factor for early
recurrence after RH \[27\].

18.7 The Role of Minimally Invasive Surgery

RH is technically more difficult than primary resection because of
adhesions, changes in liver morphology, formation of collateral
circulation, and smaller liver remnants. These changes lead to an
increased risk of intraoperative bleeding and iatrogenic damage. A
history of previous abdominal surgery was traditionally considered a
contraindication for laparoscopic surgery. Nevertheless, laparoscopic RH
is increasingly adopted worldwide and has proven feasible, safe, and
effective \[28, 29\]. In a recent meta-analysis, laparoscopic RH has
shown less blood loss, fewer major complications, and a higher R0
resection rate compared to open RH \[30\]. These findings are probably
attributable to several advantages of minimally invasive surgery. The
magnification and high-resolution view offered by laparoscopy allow a
more precise dissection. The pressure of the pneumoperitoneum increases
facilitates the separation of the adhesions. Furthermore, the adhesions
in non-operating fields could be circumvented by laparoscopic
instruments, thus minimizing the section of vascular and lymphatic
collaterals, which contributes to the development of postoperative
ascites.

However, an appropriate patient selection seems to be necessary. A
recent analysis involving 42 high-volume centers around the world has
shown that laparoscopic RH was generally reserved for patients with
relatively poor performance status and liver function, but favorable
tumor characteristics \[31\]. In this context, Kinoshita et al. have
developed a classification of the difficulty of laparoscopic RH \[32\].
High-difficulty patients have been associated with longer operating
times, greater intraoperative bleeding, and more postoperative
complications and should therefore be treated by expert teams in
high-volume centers.

All these considerations should also encourage the laparoscopic approach
from the first-time surgery, which has also been shown to favor SLT in
terms of intra-operative bleeding \[33\].

18.8 Resection of Hepatocellular Carcinoma Recurrence After Liver
Transplantation

A few small series report liver resections for recurrent HCC in
transplanted livers. Graft resection can be technically challenging due
to extensive adhesions and high morbidity rates, which are mainly
related to infective complications in immunosuppressed patients \[34\].
In a large multicenter series, Sapisochin et al. report significant
long-term OS (50% at 5 years) in patients amenable to curative-intent
treatment, including resection \[35\]. In a more recent analysis, Bodzin
et al. showed that surgical treatment, including graft resection in
well-selected patients, was associated with significantly improved OS
compared to nonsurgical and supportive therapy \[36\]. Taken together,
these data support pursuing aggressive therapy in highly selected
patients. However, mortality predictors, the impact of the treatment
procedure, and recurrence characteristics still need more in-depth
assessment in large multi-center studies.

18.9 Conclusions

In conclusion, centralization should be the practical solution to the
problem of how to treat HCC recurrence. In high-resource countries,
treatment modality should not be conditioned by the availability of the
treatments that are in place in small non-specialized centers. To ensure
equal treatment of these patients, every case should be referred to
high-volume specialized centers, where the appropriate treatment options
are discussed in a multidisciplinary context and easily available.

19.1 Introduction

From the time of its initial developments in the early 60s, liver
transplantation (LT) appeared as the ideal cure for hepatocellular
carcinoma (HCC) in liver cirrhosis because it provided the prospect of
curing at the same time both the tumor and the underlying liver disease.
However, the first experiences were disappointing, with many authors
reporting a 5-year survival of less than 40% mainly because of
recurrences of the primary tumor. A retrospective review of these
discouraging results progressively led to the observation that patient
survival was directly related to the stage of HCC at the time of LT. In
several studies from the early 90s it was found that the survival of
patients with incidental and small size nodules of HCC was increased
compared to those who underwent liver resection. Recurrence in
incidental/small tumors occurred in less than 15% of cases \[1\].

19.2 Liver Transplantation for Hepatocellular Carcinoma: The Milan
Criteria

These were the basis on which a prospective study was conducted in Milan
applying a priori restrictive criteria for the selection of HCC
candidates for LT (namely a single nodule ≤5 cm or ≤3 nodules ≤3 cm,
each with no macrovascular invasion at pre-transplant imaging). The
seminal paper published in 1996 demonstrated that by applying such
criteria it was possible to obtain long-term results that were better
than for any other therapy applied for HCC \[2\], and similar to the
outcomes of LT for non-oncologic indications. These so-called Milan
criteria (MC) incorporated both single and multiple presentation of HCC
and were subsequently validated by many other groups reporting 5-year
survival rates of 70% or better, with recurrence rates below 15%, and
became the benchmark for selecting patients with HCC for LT. After their
implementation, the favorable post-transplant outcomes that were
observed in cohort series were so convincing that further validation by
randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was prevented. HCC, declared in 1989
a relative contraindication to LT by the US Department of Health, is
today the second indication for LT in Europe (26.9% of indications) and
it has therefore become one of the major fields of interest in
hepatology and liver surgery.

19.3 Expanding Indications and Improving Results of Liver
Transplantation for Hepatocellular Carcinoma

HCCs meeting the MC have been confirmed to be a separate prognostic
category associated with good outcomes after LT and incorporated into
major guidelines. However, in the absence of surveillance programs, only
a minority of HCC are diagnosed at an early stage (namely within the
MC), and excellent results have been observed in patients who underwent
LT with an HCC exceeding the MC. These patients constitute the focus of
debate about what is known as "expansion HCC criteria" for LT, either
because they are selected as beyond the MC before transplantation or
because they are selected as a result of being downstaged to meet the MC
after neoadjuvant treatments (Fig. 19.1).

Fig. 19.1Tumor-related strategies affecting the prognosis of patients
undergoing liver transplantation for hepatocellular carcinoma

19.3.1 Role of Neoadjuvant Therapies: Bridging to Liver Transplantation,
Salvage, and Pre-emptive Liver Transplantation

The application of conventional therapies for HCC to candidates within
MC as a bridge to LT has the primary objective of preventing tumor
progression beyond conventional criteria during waiting list time, and
consequently preventing dropout. Dropout rates increase with waiting
list time, and the risk of dropout for HCC candidates is higher than the
risk for candidates with non-malignant diseases after the first three
months \[3\]. The rates of dropout depend on many variables linked to
the individual tumor biology and to each transplantation center. For
tumors with expected waiting times to LT \<6 months, there is no
evidence that neoadjuvant treatments are beneficial. For T2 tumors and
for longer waiting times, neoadjuvant treatments are usually performed
with transarterial chemoembolization, ablation techniques and liver
resection in selected cases. Tumor stage and volume, alpha-fetoprotein
(AFP) levels, response to treatments, and liver function affect the risk
of dropout from the waiting list. These factors, together with vascular
invasion and poor tumor differentiation, are major determinants of poor
post-LT outcomes \[4\].

Because of the organ shortage, hepatic resection might serve as primary
therapy for HCC, with LT as a salvage procedure in the case of
recurrence. Initial experiences reported unfavorable outcomes for
primary resection and salvage LT compared to primary LT \[5\].
Remarkably, secondary LT was associated with significantly higher
operative mortality. Further studies, however, reported comparable
intention-to-treat outcomes of HCC patients treated with primary LT or
primary resection followed by salvage LT in the case of recurrence. In
particular, when liver resection is performed with a minimally invasive
approach, the risk of delisting, post-transplant patient death and tumor
recurrence seem reduced when compared to open surgery \[6\].

Liver resection with pathological analysis of the specimen allows
clinicians to identify those patients at high risk for recurrence (e.g.,
microvascular invasion, satellite lesions, high grade of
differentiation) who might benefit from being listed for LT immediately
after resection. The strategy of pre-emptive (or de principe) LT was
introduced by the Barcelona group \[7\], and the authors demonstrated
excellent long-term outcomes for patients who underwent LT after
resection for a high-risk HCC. The feasibility of the pre-emptive LT
strategy implies a high availability of liver grafts and a policy of
transplanting patients with a high probability of recurrence even though
still tumorless: the benefit of preventing an HCC recurrence by means of
LT should be carefully balanced with the potential harm caused by the LT
itself.

19.3.2 Beyond the Milan Criteria

Several experiences suggested that the restrictive MC may exclude from
LT those patients with a more extensive disease but still in the range
of a possible cure. The key aspect of selection criteria is that the
definitions used should identify those patients who, despite exceeding
the MC, might still do well without an increase in recurrence. At the
same time, the definitions should also identify those patients within
the MC that will be at high risk of recurrence. This two-end goal is
paramount for the equitable use of the available organs.

The proposals for expansion of the MC were initially developed using
tumor morphology, namely size and number. These factors have in fact
been shown to be surrogate markers of microvascular invasion (MVI)
and/or poor tumor differentiation, which are the principal determinants
of tumor aggressiveness and consequent risk of post-LT recurrence \[8\].
Expanded morphological criteria increased the acceptable size and number
of HCC nodules with respect to the MC, but the great heterogeneity and
different accuracies of liver imaging techniques probably represent the
greatest limitation of criteria based only on morphology.

In order to overcome these limits, criteria incorporating serum markers,
such as AFP, that surrogate biological tumor characteristics have been
proposed (Table 19.1). In particular, by combining the morphological
characteristics of the tumor and the AFP values, it was possible to
develop selection criteria for LT that definitively exceeded those of
Milan without significantly increasing the risk of post-LT recurrence
\[9, 10\]. The calculation of both the size and number of nodules and
the AFP serum levels appears simple and available in every context,
making these models applicable "dynamically", in addition to the
assessment of the HCC response to neoadjuvant treatments. Through
multiple predictions made at each interval after tumor treatment,
variations of prognosis during the course of disease can be
determined.Table 19.1Examples of selection criteria for liver

Finally, tumor differentiation, MVI, presence of circulating cancer
cells and genomic markers have also been suggested as selection criteria
for LT, but this assessment requires taking a biopsy that might induce
tumor seeding. Furthermore, it is well known that tumors are
heterogeneous and show areas of varying degrees of differentiation and
genomic features. Hence, such an assessment is not 100% robust and no
molecular signature has been properly validated. Nevertheless, it is
clear that other parameters beyond tumor size and number will play an
increasingly important role in the selection for LT of HCC patients
beyond MC.

19.3.3 Downstaging of Hepatocellular Carcinoma Before Liver
Transplantation

Downstaging is defined as a treatment given to HCC patients that are not
eligible for LT because of tumors beyond conventional criteria, with the
objective of reducing tumor burden (in terms of number, size or tumor
vitality) to meet pre-established conventional limits (generally Milan
or UCSF Criteria) that are considered acceptable for LT. HCC is rarely
technically "non-transplantable", and in this case downstaging
treatments are performed with the aim of a migration to a stage with
better prognosis (the MC). This strategy is treated separately in the
following chapter. However, it is worth emphasizing that its
effectiveness recently emerged in a RCT (XXL trial) demonstrating with a
high level of evidence that, after sustained and successful downstaging
of HCC beyond the MC, LT achieves a significant survival benefit with
respect to any other non-transplant therapy \[11\].

19.3.4 Role of Adjuvant Treatments

Despite strict selection criteria, tumor recurrence after LT for HCC
occurs in up to 20% of the cases \[12\] and is associated with a poor
prognosis. The main strategies to prevent HCC recurrence involve
adjuvant treatments and modulation of immunosuppression. Systemic
therapy with several drugs (e.g., cisplatin or 5-fluorouracil) have
failed to provide any benefit. Sorafenib, an oral multikinase inhibitor
that improves survival of patients with advanced HCC, has been tested in
some studies to prevent or treat HCC recurrence after liver
transplantation. No solid evidence emerged from these studies and, even
though its safety was confirmed, the potential for effective HCC
treatment using sorafenib after transplant is doubtful \[13\].

Immunosuppression is a risk factor for tumor growth: the calcineurin
inhibitors (CNI) cyclosporin and tacrolimus currently form the main
components of immunosuppression after LT, although their potential
tumor-promoting action is well known \[14\]. Several studies reported a
higher risk of tumor recurrence for patients treated with high doses of
CNIs, especially in the first month after LT \[15\]. Thus, an adequate
balance between low immunosuppression and the risk of rejection should
be encouraged. Because of their immunosuppressive and antiproliferative
effects, the mTOR inhibitors sirolimus and everolimus have been
suggested for immunosuppression of HCC patients. Several retrospective
analyses and meta-analyses have reported a protective effect of
sirolimus on the risk of post-LT HCC recurrence. All these data have
been challenged by the negative results of a prospective phase III,
international multicenter RCT that randomized patients to sirolimus and
sirolimus-free immunosuppression regimens, reporting no difference in
5-year disease-free survival \[16\]. Thus, the use of mTOR inhibitors to
reduce tumor recurrence cannot currently be recommended.

19.4 Organ Allocation in Patients with Hepatocellular Carcinoma

In most Western countries, liver allocation follows the principle of
urgency, allocating the available organ to the sickest first. The MELD
score, originally developed by the United Network for Organ Sharing
Priority (UNOS), is used to prioritize patients with the highest
short-term mortality risk. As it solely consists of biochemical
variables (i.e., bilirubin, creatinine, INR), it would fail to assess
the risk of disease progression and dropout in patients with malignant
disease and compensated liver function. Thus, most allocation systems
will give exception points to patients with HCC, with pre-fixed
increases over time, in order to equalize the risk of death or dropout
in both populations. However, a system that guarantees fixed points at
baseline and fixed increases does not allow an equitable graft
allocation between patients with and without cancer or a correct
prioritization amongst patients with HCC at different stages and risk of
dropout. To solve this issue, it has been recently suggested that
priority be stratified for patients with HCC according to stage,
response to therapy and evolution after therapy \[17\]. This kind of
model does not require pre-determined entry criteria, and eligibility to
transplant and priority is defined at the end of the therapeutic
neoadjuvant process, namely after the best available therapy has been
completed. Thus, preliminary tumor response to treatments could become
the most flexible and defined criteria for expanding the indication to
LT in HCC beyond the MC, without compromising the post-transplant
outcome and therefore fully justifying the use of donated organs for
cancer patients. This concept, which is a blend between urgency and
utility principles also considering other variables related to local
scenarios and resource distributions, has been adopted in Italy since
2016 and may improve the transparency and the efficacy of the allocation
systems in place for HCC patients \[18\].

19.5 Future of Liver Transplantation for Hepatocellular Carcinoma

The number of patients diagnosed with HCC in several areas around the
world is increasing. At the same time, the introduction of direct-acting
antiviral agents has dramatically improved the outcome of patients
infected with hepatitis C virus and will result in a reduced number of
patients in need of LT because of end-stage liver disease. As a
consequence, in the near future, it is expected that more organs will be
available for patients with liver cancer, potentially justifying a
careful expansion of the selection criteria.

The increase of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) in the Western
world has increased the rate of this disease as an indication for LT as
well as an etiopathological factor for HCC. To date, conflicting
evidence exists on the outcomes after LT for patients with NASH-related
HCC compared to patients with HCC of different etiologies. Some studies
have suggested a better oncological outcome when treating patients with
HCC and NASH but, on the other hand, the post-LT outcomes of patients
with NASH might be significantly affected by the associated
comorbidities (obesity, diabetes, hypertension).

Current research targets clinical and molecular predictors of the risk
of post-transplant recurrence, with the objective of overcoming the
limits of current selection criteria based on morphology and serum tumor
markers. Overall, this will hopefully result in a wider and more
individualized access to the waiting lists. Identifying adjuvant
strategies to reduce the risk of recurrence represents an unmet need, as
does defining the most cost-effective approach for detecting and
treating tumor recurrence after transplantation.

20.1 Introduction

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common liver cancer with
rising incidence over the past two decades. HCC is a leading indication
for liver transplantation (LT), which can remove the tumor and the
cirrhotic liver. The Milan Criteria (MC), proposed by Mazzaferro et al.
\[1\] in 1996, have stood the test of time and have remained the
benchmark for the selection of candidates for LT. They consider HCC with
a single lesion ≤5 cm or ≤3 lesions ≤3 cm and account for 2-year and
5-year post-transplant survival rates of 75--95% and 70--80%,
respectively. MC have been endorsed by both the European Association for
the Study of the Liver (EASL) \[2\] and the American Association for the
Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) \[3\]. Subsequently, they have been
incorporated in the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) classification
and in the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) TNM classification.
However, it has been proven that a modest expansion of the MC can
achieve similar post-LT survival.

The term "downstaging" (DS) refers to the application of locoregional
therapy (LRT) to tumors outside the accepted transplant criteria,
commonly MC, with the aim of reducing tumor burden and selecting
appropriate candidates for LT. DS provides a viable alternative approach
to expand the limits of the MC.

Conversely, the term "bridging" refers to the application of LRT to
those HCC patients on the waiting list to reduce the risk of dropout
when the expected transplant waiting time is \>6 months.

20.2 Indications

There are no universally accepted upper limits, no inclusion/exclusion
criteria for DS protocols, nor is there a standard definition of
successful DS. Until a few years ago, DS protocols were mainly based on
the assessment of tumor burden and tumor response to LRT according to
radiological criteria, such as the modified Response Evaluation Criteria
in Solid Tumors (mRECIST) criteria \[4\]. Modern DS protocols also tend
to consider the response in terms of biomarkers. Additionally, even
patients with more advanced oncological disease, such as HCC with portal
vein tumor thrombosis (PVTT), can be considered for LT.

20.2.1 Morphological Criteria

The latest EASL \[2\] and AASLD \[3\] guidelines suggest that patients
beyond the MC or T3 stage should be considered for LT after successful
DS to meet the MC. In 2005 Yao et al. \[5\] proposed the University of
California San Francisco (UCSF) DS protocol. In brief, the eligibility
criteria for enrolment into this DS protocol included a single lesion ≤8
cm and total tumor diameter ≤8 cm. Patients with HCC successfully
downstaged presented a 5-year post-LT \[78% vs. 81%, p = 0.66) and
intention-to-treat survival rate \[56% vs. 63.3%, p = 0.29) comparable
to the control group of patients with T2 HCC \[6\].

20.2.2 Combining the Morphological with the Biological Criteria

Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels have shown to be highly predictive of
patient survival \[7, 8\], and several cut-offs have been proposed for
incorporation into transplant criteria, ranging from 100--500 ng/mL;
however, no consensus has been reached on how to combine them with HCC
morphological features. Duvoux et al. \[8\] observed that patients
exceeding the MC with AFP \<100 ng/mL presented with a lower 5-year risk
of recurrence in comparison with patients with AFP \>1000 ng/mL.

In an effort to standardize the DS criteria for HCC in 2017, UNOS
(United Network for Organ Sharing) adopted the UCSF/Region 5 DS protocol
(UNOS-DS) as a new national policy in the United States (Table 20.1)
\[9, 10\]. This protocol emphasizes two important novel concepts:(a)

patients with elevated AFP, even \>1000 ng/mL, could still be considered
for inclusion provided that there was a significant drop in AFP to \<500
ng/mL;

\(b\)

the stability of the disease after DS for a period of 6 months.

A recent study by Metha et al. \[7\] evaluated the results of the
UNOS-DS protocol, comparing three groups of patients: those always
within the MC (n = 3276), those within the UNOS-DS criteria and
successful downstaged (n = 422), and "all-comers" (AC) with an initial
tumor burden beyond the UNOS-DS criteria (n = 121). They demonstrated
comparable 3-year post-LT survival between patients meeting UNOS-DS
criteria, successfully downstaged (79%), and those within MC (83%).
Nevertheless, the 3-year post-LT survival in the AC cohort was
significantly lower than the other two groups, at 71%.Table 20.1Summary
of UNOS Criteria for DS (UNOS-DS)

Inclusion criteria

(a) Single lesion 5.1--8 cm

(b) 2--3 lesions each ≤5 cm with the sum of the maximal tumor diameters
≤8 cm

(c) 4--5 lesions each ≤3 cm with the sum of the maximal tumor diameters
≤8 cm

(d) Absence of vascular invasion or extrahepatic disease

Criteria for successful DS

Residual tumor size and diameter within MC (1 lesion ≤5 cm, 2--3 lesions

Criteria for DS failure

(a) Progression of tumor(s)

(b) Tumor invasion of a major hepatic vessel based on cross-sectional
imaging

(c) Lymph node involvement by tumor or extrahepatic spread of tumor

(d) Infiltrative tumor growth pattern

(e) Decrease of AFP to \<500 ng/mL if before DS AFP ≥1000 ng/mL

Timing of LT in relation to DS

(a) Minimum observation period of 3 months of disease stability from
successful DS to LT

(b) Patient must remain within MC for 6 months after successful DS

liver transplantation; MC Milan Criteria; UNOS United Network for Organ
Sharing

Therefore, it can be concluded that:Data available so far support
favorable outcomes of DS followed by LT for those HCC patients beyond
the MC

Important factors to consider when assessing the response to DS are:The
morphological response, usually assessed by the mRECIST criteria

The biological response, usually assessed by the drop in AFP

The stability of disease over time after LRT.

20.2.3 The Issue of Portal Vein Thrombosis

Another controversial issue is whether patients with HCC and neoplastic
PVTT should be considered for LT after successful DS. Additionally,
transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) has been contraindicated in HCC
patients with PVTT. However, as shown by Ettorre at al. \[11, 12\],
patients treated with transarterial radioembolization (TARE) with a
complete response for the thrombosis associated with biochemical
response can achieve a favorable oncological outcome (Fig. 20.1).

Fig. 20.1(a) Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with right portal vein tumor
thrombosis. (b) HCC after transarterial radioembolization showing tumor
response and disappearance of right portal vein tumor thrombosis. (c)
Macroscopic appearance of HCC after liver transplantation

Therefore, PVTT should no longer be regarded as an absolute
contraindication to LT: very selected patients responding to TARE could
be considered for LT. Nevertheless, solid prospective data validating
these findings are still needed.

20.3 When

Depending on the timing of DS, two main scenarios can be identified:DS
an HCC otherwise unsuitable for transplantation before listing. It
refers to patients with HCC beyond the MC and selected for DS therapies
before LT. This strategy has a double rationale: meeting morphological
and biological inclusion criteria for LT and selecting HCC patients with
favorable biological features. The concept of a "wait and see strategy"
after LRT and before LT is of paramount importance \[9\].

Rescue patient with HCC with progression while on the waiting list. In
these cases, DS therapies should still be considered, and in case of
regression, the patient could be re-listed for LT.

20.4 How

20.4.1 Transarterial Chemoembolization

TACE is the most common DS approach. It is based on the concept that HCC
is highly dependent on arterial supply. TACE is performed by the
administration of chemotherapeutics (i.e., doxorubicin or cisplatin)
mixed with an oil-base vehicle (lipiodol), followed by embolization with
gelfoam of the artery supplying the tumor. Thus, the chemotherapeutic
effect is intensified by ischemia. Complications following TACE can
occur in up to 25--45% of cases, with the majority being
post-embolization syndrome characterized by a reversible elevation of
transaminases and bilirubin, fever, abdominal pain and nausea. Other
possible complications are liver or renal failure, liver or splenic
abscess, hepatic artery damage, upper gastrointestinal bleeding and
gastroduodenal ulcer. When there is risk of decompensation,
superselective TACE should be recommended to reduce toxicity.
Additionally, in order to decrease the risk of arterial complications
after TACE in patients listed for LT, drug-eluting bead TACE (DEB-TACE)
has been developed. This approach is based on the administration of
microspheres that, with their reduced size, minimize the angiogenetic
effect on the main arterial branches. However, the potential benefit of
DEB-TACE has never been confirmed: the Precision Italian Trial \[13\]
comparing DEB-TACE with conventional TACE did not show significant
differences between the two approaches.

Contraindications of TACE include Child-Turcotte-Pugh class C disease,
main portal vein thrombosis, active peptic ulcer, serum bilirubin \>3
mg/dL, renal insufficiency, ascites, elevated prothrombin time and low
platelet count \[2, 3\].

The literature reports successful rates in DS ranging from 24--70%. Even
though TACE is the most used method, there have been no large
prospective trials comparing TACE with other DS approaches before LT.
Therefore, although the available data seem encouraging, there is still
a lack of strong evidence-based recommendations on its role in
comparison to other DS approaches.

20.4.2 Transarterial Radioembolization

TARE has recently gained interest. It is based on the utilization of
yttrium-90 (Y-90) carried by glass or resin microspheres. Y-90 is a 100%
beta emitter injected into the branches of the hepatic artery feeding
the HCC. Y-90 half-time is 2.67 days, which means that almost the entire
amount of radiation is delivered into the HCC within 2 weeks of the
injection. The procedure aims to achieve tumor necrosis by radiation
instead of interrupting the arterial supply as with TACE. Thanks to a
mean tissue penetration of 2.5 mm, it does not damage the surrounding
liver.

In comparison with TACE, TARE has two main advantages: the highly
concentrated radioactive substance administrated into the HCC does not
harm the remaining liver parenchyma, and it preserves the arterial blood
supply, so that it can be used in patients with portal vein thrombosis.
The most common side effect of TARE is post radioembolization syndrome
with an incidence between 20 and 70%. This consists of fatigue, nausea,
abdominal pain and loss of appetite, peaking within the first 2 weeks
post-TARE administration. Other relatively unusual toxic effects are
radioembolization-induced liver disease, gastroduodenal ulcer/bleeding,
biliary toxicity and radiation pneumonitis. Before administering the
microspheres, a mandatory mesenteric angiography with
technetium-99-labeled leukocytes is needed 2 weeks before the TARE to
detect and quantify the presence of shunts to the gastrointestinal tract
or lung. If shunts are ≥20% of the hepatic artery blood flow, or if a
radiation dose \>30 Gy is absorbed by the lungs, there is a high risk of
gastroduodenal ulcer and radiation pneumonitis, and therefore TARE
should not be performed.

The effectiveness of TARE in downsizing tumors prior to surgery is
variable. Ettorre et al. showed successful DS in 78.9% of cases in 22
patients who received TARE prior to LT \[12\]. A recent systematic
review \[14\] described a successful DS rate between 8 and 100%. There
have been few prospective studies comparing TACE with TARE in the
setting of DS patients before LT; the PREMIERE trial \[15\], a pilot
trial comparing TARE vs. TACE in unresectable HCC, suggested that TARE
appeared to be as safe and tolerated as multiple sessions of TACE.
Additionally, TARE is the preferred DS option in patients with HCC and
PVTT \[16\].

20.4.3 Ablative Therapies

Several ablative procedures have been proposed:Radiofrequency ablation:
the most common ablation technique employed for its advantages in terms
of efficacy, cost-effectiveness and tolerability. The limitations of
radiofrequency ablation include lesion size, proximity of the lesion to
blood vessels due to a "heat-sink effect", where heat is lost due to the
nearby flow of blood, proximity to bile ducts due to the risk of
stenosis, and proximity to vital structures or the diaphragm.

Microwave ablation: with similar indications and contraindications to
those of radiofrequency ablation but producing a wider and more
homogeneous ablation zone, ablating larger volumes with less "heat-sink
effect". The procedural time is shorter.

Ethanol injection: nowadays, only used when other techniques are not
available, due to the lower rate of local tumor response.

Cryoablation: now replaced by more modern LRT, as it has been associated
with severe post-procedure morbidity and high local recurrence rates

Irreversible electroporation: there is a paucity of data on its use and
it is applied less often, as it is more expensive and requires general
anesthesia.

Stereotactic body radiotherapy: there is still paucity of data on its
use as a DS.

20.4.4 Surgery

Liver resection has been traditionally used as a form of primary
treatment for HCC; however, several reports have confirmed its potential
as a bridging or DS strategy for HCC before LT \[17\]. The rationale of
this strategy is based on the following clinical observations:a
proportion of patients may survive without recurrence for 5--10 years
without the need for LT;

a "rescue" LT, in the case of HCC recurrence, will have similar short-
and long-term outcomes as primary LT.

It could be argued that an operated abdomen could make LT technically
more difficult and demanding. However, the recent diffusion of
laparoscopic liver resection (LLR) plays an important role in this
field, as it has been associated with reduced post-operative adhesions.
LLR could be considered the best surgical option for peripheral tumors,
especially if located in the left lobe or in anterior segments (S4b--S5)
\[18\]. Laurent et al. \[19\] published the first series reporting LT
after LLR for HCC showing that LLR prior to LT is a safe procedure with
no mortality in 24 consecutive patients and associated with a potential
technical advantage for the subsequent LT. More recently, robotic liver
surgery before LT has shown encouraging results as well. Data from an
Italian multicenter study confirmed that salvage LT after minimally
invasive liver surgery seems safer than those LT performed after open
liver resection \[20\].

20.4.5 Combination Methods

In order to achieve a successful DS, it is frequent in clinical practice
to combine DS therapies either in a simultaneous or sequential fashion.
For example, in the case of unsuccessful TACE, patients with persistent
disease can be subjected to TARE. Similarly, HCC recurrence after LLR
can be managed with LRT. Every possible effort should be made in order
to successfully downstage HCC patients included within accepted DS
protocols.

20.5 Conclusions

The goal of DS is to allow the opportunity of LT to a larger portion of
HCC patients without affecting the survival benefit. Robust data
emphasize that the sole reliance on radiologic tumor size and number is
a relatively crude method to measure the complexity of HCC cases. The
modern approach has shifted from a morphological to a combined
morphological plus biochemical approach. AFP, novel biomarkers and
response to DS protocol should be utilized as predictors of post-LT
outcomes. Additionally, PVTT does not represent an absolute
contraindication for DS protocols.

TACE represents the most used DS approach while TARE has shown some
benefit in DS patients with larger tumors and with PVTT. Ablative
therapies, usually used as primary treatment for HCC in unfit patients
with small lesions, have shown encouraging results even as LRT. Liver
resections by minimally invasive approaches are emerging as possible
alternatives for DS. Given the complexity of this disease, it is
difficult to determine a specific DS method that is more successful than
the others. In general, careful patient selection combined with
aggressive LRT appears to have the best outcomes in the long term.

In conclusion, prospective multicenter, well-designed studies are
necessary to identify and validate reliable selection parameters and
protocols. Regional disparities in LT waiting times and program-specific
practices should dictate patient eligibility for DS and individualized
treatment decisions must be taken within multidisciplinary teams
involving radiologists, hepatologists, surgeons, pathologists and
oncologists.

21.1 Introduction

The identification of single pathways responsible for carcinogenesis is
inconclusive. Different genetic, epigenetic and microenvironment
alterations affecting intracellular signaling cascades are involved. The
development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the result of the
underlying disease, cirrhosis in most of the cases, liver immune status
and microenvironment. Moreover, the different etiology of hepatic
infection, hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV), the role
of alcohol, the increasing evidence of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis
(NASH) associated with metabolic syndrome or diabetes, make possible
different backgrounds for the development of HCC \[1--3\].

Different pathways have been implicated in the pathogenesis and
progression of HCC. Among them, telomerase activation via TERT promoter
mutations, evading cell senescence, Wnt/β-catenin signaling, by
mutations or inactivation, and the AKT-mTOR and MAPK pathways seem to be
the most interesting.

The liver is an immune-tolerant organ, a condition enabling it to cope
with the large number of immunogenic signals coming from the gut. On the
other hand, a failure to clear harmful stimuli, as viral or metabolic
stress, may lead to chronic inflammation with characteristic hepatic
stigmata \[4\]. There is no evidence for the detection of programmed
death-1 (PD-1)/PD-ligand (PD-L1) PDL-1 expression as a
prognostic/predictive factor for immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI)
activity. This complex network is made more complicated by vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF) production by tumor cells and the
surrounding stroma. Besides promoting tumor angiogenesis, VEGF inhibits
the antigen-presenting functions and T cell stimulatory ability of
dendritic cells (DCs), and generates myeloid-derived suppressor cells
(MDSCs) and regulatory T cells (Tsreg) \[5\]. Inhibition of VEGF by
bevacizumab and an anti-PDL-1 agent such as atezolizumab represents a
synergistic way to overcome VEGF inhibition as shown in the IMbrave
trial.

Different prognostic systems have been proposed for HCC. Among them, the
Italian CLIP (Cancer for Liver Cancer) score and the BCLC (Barcelona
Clinic Liver Cancer) algorithm have been mostly used in Western
countries. The CLIP score is calculated on the Child-Pugh classification
of cirrhosis, tumor volume, portal thrombosis and alpha-fetoprotein
(AFP) value. The CLIP score is prognostic, with survival decreasing from
41.5 months (score 0) to only 3.4 months (scores 4--6) \[6\].

The BCLC algorithm introduces the ECOG (Eastern Cooperative Oncology
Group) performance status among the prognostic factors and, more
relevant, indicates when a local treatment or a systemic treatment
represents the best option. Moreover, it is largely used in clinical
trials. Recent modifications in study designs include the separation of
extrahepatic spread and portal vein invasion, the importance of elevated
AFP levels, and the incorporation of mRECIST (modified Response
Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors) assessments \[7\].

The natural history of advanced-stage HCC patients involves a median
overall survival (OS) of about 8 months, a progression-free-survival
(PFS) of less than 6 months, with rare objective responses (OR) and
frequent complications due to the underlying disease.

Currently six systemic therapies have been approved based on phase III
trials (atezolizumab plus bevacizumab, sorafenib, lenvatinib,
regorafenib, cabozantinib, and ramucirumab) and three additional
therapies have obtained accelerated FDA approval owing to evidence of
efficacy. New trials are evaluating combination therapies, including ICI
and tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) or anti-VEGF therapies, or even
immunotherapy combinations.

21.2 First-Line Therapy

21.2.1 Single Agents

TKI are the most studied single agents in HCC. Two drugs are now
approved in the first-line setting, sorafenib and lenvatinib. More than
15 years ago sorafenib showed an increase in OS when compared to placebo
in the SHARP trail (10.7 months versus 7.9 months) and in a parallel
Asian trial. Efficacy of sorafenib was confirmed in a meta-analysis in
patients with HCV-associated HCC and liver-only disease, who showed
greater benefit than those with HCC from non-HCV causes or with
extrahepatic disease \[8, 9\].

Lenvatinib is a recent TKI agent, initially studied in thyroid cancer,
with a more potent inhibition against VEGF receptors. In the
non-inferiority phase III REFLECT trial head-to-head against sorafenib,
lenvatinib improved median OS from the 12.3 months of sorafenib to 13.6
months. It seems relevant that the arm with sorafenib performed better
than the original arm in the SHARP trial. The study excluded patients
with extrahepatic main portal vein invasion or in whom \>50% of the
liver was involved. Lenvatinib also significantly improved PFS (7.4
versus 3.7 months; HR 0.66, 95% 95% CI 0.57--0.77; p \< 0.001). For the
first time, a clinical activity in terms of objective response rate
(ORR) was found (24.1% versus 9.2%; 95% CI 2.15--4.56; p \< 0.0001)
according to mRECIST, with hypertension being the prevalent side effect
of lenvatinib. Lenvatinib is a new standard first-line of treatment in
advanced HCC \[10\].

21.2.2 Combination Therapies

Given that angiogenesis promotes the formation of an immunosuppressive
environment, the combination of atezolizumab (anti-PDL-1 antibody) and
bevacizumab (anti-VEGF antibody) was studied for synergistic antitumor
effects.

The IMbrave150 trial was an open-label prospective randomized phase III
study in unresectable untreated hepatocellular carcinoma; 336 patients
were treated with the combination of atezolizumab and bevacizumab and
165 with sorafenib. OS at 12 months with the combination was 67.2% (95%
CI 61.3--73.1) versus 54.6% (95% CI, 45.2--64.0) with sorafenib. Median
PFS was 6.8 months (95% CI, 5.7--8.3) and 4.3 months (95% CI, 4.0--5.6).
Grade 3--4 adverse events were not different (56.5% with combination
versus 55.1% with sorafenib). Hypertension grade 3--4 affected 15.2% of
patients treated with bevacizumab. All patients had been previously
studied with gastroscopy for detection of gastric varices. This
combination now represents the new standard treatment for advanced HCC
patients who have no contraindications to bevacizumab or atezolizumab.
Patient-reported outcomes were also better for the combination arm, with
the median time to deterioration of quality of life being 11.2 months
compared with 3.6 months for sorafenib. Cost-effectiveness analyses
indicate a threshold of \$ 150,000 for a 35% incremental
quality-adjusted life-year, suggesting the need for predictive factors
for this combination \[11\].

Cabozantinib is a multi-kinase inhibitor with activity against VEGF
receptor 2, AXL and MET. The COSMIC-312 trial, recently presented at
ESMO 2021, is a phase III trial, comparing cabozantinib plus
atezolizumab (432 patients) versus sorafenib (217 patients) as
first-line treatment for advanced HCC. Patients were stratified by
etiology, geographic region, presence of extra-hepatic disease and/or
macrovascular invasion. The dual primary endpoint was PFS and OS. The
PFS end point was met, with 6.8 months for cabozantinib plus
atezolizumab vs. 4.2 months for sorafenib (HR 0.63; 95% CI 0.44--0.91; p
= 0.001). The interim analysis for OS did not show a statistically
significant benefit for the combination. Grade 3/4 adverse events
occurred in 54% of patients with cabozantinib plus atezolizumab vs. 32%
with sorafenib, with hypertension and increased transaminase levels
being most frequent. Final analysis for survival is ongoing \[12\].

These two phase III trials reinforce the role of combining TKI and ICI
versus sorafenib. At this time no direct comparison of ICI + TKI
combinations versus lenvatinib has been completed, nor is there a clear
selection of patients who could benefit from one of the two options. In
the absence of head-to-head trials or established biomarkers, treatment
decisions must rely upon the magnitude of benefits, drug toxicity
profiles and drug availability. A note of caution comes from
experimental data reporting a lack of response to ICI in patients with
NASH-induced HCC. A meta-analysis of three randomized trials in 1600
patients treated with ICI revealed that ICI did not improve survival in
this important subgroup of patients \[13\].

Trials stratified by etiology of HCC need to be run in order to clarify
this question.

21.3 Second-Line Therapies

21.3.1 Single Agents

Three drugs (regorafenib, cabozantinib and ramucirumab) were approved
for the treatment of HCC patients after progression on sorafenib. In
addition, three additional ICI alternatives, namely nivolumab,
pembrolizumab and nivolumab plus ipilimumab, have been approved by the
FDA after a first-line treatment with sorafenib.

Regorafenib, a multi-kinase inhibitor targeting VEGF receptors 1--3 and
other kinases, demonstrated a survival advantage over placebo after
sorafenib. The median OS with regorafenib was 10.6 months versus 7.8
months with placebo (HR 0.63, 95% CI 0.50--0.79; p \< 0.0001). The
median PFS was 3.1 months versus 1.5 months (HR 0.46, 95% CI 0.37--0.56;
p \< 0.0001) and the ORR was 11% and 4% for regorafenib and placebo,
respectively \[14\].

The CELESTIAL trial demonstrated an improvement in the median OS for
cabozantinib (10.2 months) compared with placebo (8 months; HR 0.76, 95%
CI 0.63--0.92; p = 0.0049) and in median PFS (5.2 months with
cabozantinib versus 1.9 months with placebo; HR 0.44, 95% CI 0.36--0.52;
p \< 0.001) \[15\].

Ramucirumab is the only biomarker-guided therapy for HCC in patients
with baseline AFP levels of ≥400 ng/dL. In the REACH-2 trial ramucirumab
demonstrated an improvement in OS (8.5 months versus 7.3 months in the
placebo group; 95% CI 0.531--0.949; p = 0.0199). PFS was increased with
ramucirumab (2.8 months versus 1.6 months; 95% CI 0.339--0.603; p \<
0.0001) with no difference in response rate \[16\].

Based on phase Ib/II data, nivolumab and pembrolizumab (anti-PD-1
inhibitors) were approved as single agents in the USA. The CheckMate 040
trial assessed nivolumab as monotherapy in 262 patients mostly as
second-line treatment, demonstrating an ORR of 14% with a median
duration of response of 17 months (95% CI 6--24). The median OS was 15.6
months and the treatment was generally well tolerated \[17\]. Similarly,
the KEYNOTE-224 trial showed an ORR of 17% with pembrolizumab with a
median PFS of 4.9 months and a median OS of 12.9 months. The
pembrolizumab-associated profile was tolerable \[18\]. These data were
not confirmed in phase 3 trials in first-line therapy in the CheckMate
459 trial exploring nivolumab versus sorafenib in the first-line setting
\[19\] and in the KEYNOTE-240 trial comparing pembrolizumab versus
placebo \[20\].

21.3.2 Emerging Combination Therapies

There at least two other very interesting combinations already active in
other tumor types, namely pembrolizumab plus lenvatinib, which is a
standard first-line treatment in renal cancer \[21\], and nivolumab plus
ipilimumab, an anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTL-4) drug used
in melanoma \[22\].

In the KEYNOTE-524 trial 100 patients were treated with the combination
of pembrolizumab plus lenvatinib as first-line treatment of advanced HCC
and the data were presented at ASCO 2020: the OR was 46%, median PFS was
9.3 months (CI 95% 5.6--9.7) and median survival 22.2 months (95% CI
20.4--NE) \[23\].

These results prompted the ongoing phase III trial LEAP-002 comparing
lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab with single agent lenvatinib in 750
untreated patients with Child-Pugh A, BCLC stage C or B HCC not amenable
to locoregional therapy, and ECOG PS 0--1; the primary endpoints are PFS
and OS \[24\].

The combination of nivolumab plus ipilimumab was first tested in
pretreated patients in the phase I/II CheckMate 040 trial in
sorafenib-pretreated patients, obtaining an OR of 32% (CI 95% 20--47)
with a median OS of 22.8 months (95% CI 9.4--NE) \[25\]. Nivolumab plus
ipilimumab is currently being tested in the CheckMate 9DW trial in 1084
patients randomized against sorafenib or lenvatinib as first-line
treatment \[26\].

At ASCO-GI 2022, final data of the HIMALAYA study with only one dose of
an anti-CTLA-4 drug, tremelimumab, followed by an anti-PDL-1, durvalumab
(the STRIDE regimen) were compared with sorafenib or durvalumab alone in
1171 patients with untreated unresectable HCC. The primary end point of
the study was met, with a median OS of 16.4 months (14.2--19.6) for
STRIDE and 13.8 (12.3--16.1) months for sorafenib (HR 0.78, p = 0.0035).
The OS for durvalumab alone was not inferior to sorafenib, with a
favorable tolerability profile. Even the STRIDE regimen may represent a
new treatment option as first-line therapy \[27\].

21.4 Conclusion

The landscape of HCC has changed profoundly in recent years moving from
a single drug, sorafenib, to different active agents, lenvatinib among
others, and some promising combinations. The development of atezolizumab
with bevacizumab or cabozantinib seems to indicate a new avenue for the
use of ICI + TKI. The concurrent use of ICI doublets, nivolumab plus
ipilimumab or tremelimumab plus durvalumab, leave the opportunity to use
TKI as second-line treatment. Still to be defined is the patient profile
of those who will benefit best from TKI alone or from doublets in terms
of biological fingerprint, tolerability and efficacy. The role of
sequential treatment, the need to integrate these new opportunities with
local treatments such as surgery or chemo-radioembolization are still
new and promising challenges.

Hepatocellular carcinomaScreeningLiver cirrhosisSurveillanceRisk

22.1 Introduction

The goal of screening is to detect subclinical disease, and when
screening is performed at regular intervals, it is called surveillance.
Almost all adult patients with cirrhosis and some patients with
non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) or chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV)
infection are at sufficiently high risk for developing hepatocellular
carcinoma (HCC) \[1\]. Imaging surveillance of at-risk patients results
in detection of HCC at an earlier stage, and the development of simple
imaging techniques and effective treatments has provided the rationale
for surveillance in high-risk populations. In this context, surveillance
has a favorable effect on outcomes and has been demonstrated to be
cost-effective \[2\].

Recommendations on specific screening, obtained from the current
guidelines produced by the European (EASL) \[3\], American (AASLD) \[4,
5\] and Asian Pacific (APASL) \[6\] associations for the study of the
liver are presented and discussed. This chapter will also review the
approach to surveillance for HCC in high-risk patients, with established
and proposed surveillance tools.

22.2 Effect of Surveillance on Outcomes

The aim of surveillance is to obtain a reduction in disease-related
mortality. This is usually achieved through a diagnosis of the disease
at the early stage that, in turn, enhances the applicability and
improves the cost-effectiveness of therapies \[7\]. Ultrasound (US) is
the non-invasive method of choice and is applied beyond HCC surveillance
to monitor the development of portal hypertension, ascites or portal
vein thrombosis.

A single randomized controlled trial (RCT) of surveillance vs. no
surveillance has only once been published \[8\]. It included more than
18,000 Chinese patients with HBV infection and showed a 37% reduction in
mortality following a strategy based on surveillance with
alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) test and US examination every 6 months. Several
systematic reviews of the literature on surveillance were performed and
aimed to guide the recommendations of the scientific societies \[9\].
The latest guideline from the AASLD analyzed 38 observational cohort
studies involving cirrhotic patients on HCC surveillance compared with
patients without. The pooled 3-year survival rate was 50.8% among those
who underwent surveillance and 27.9% among those without. The survival
benefit was mainly due to higher early-stage detection and higher
curative treatment rates.

22.2.1 Surveillance Application

Surveillance application in the real word is considered low. According
to a population-based retrospective study in Washington State, out of
1137 patients with cirrhosis, 2% underwent consistent surveillance, 33%
had inconsistent surveillance, and 65% received no surveillance during
follow-up \[10\]. Racial and socioeconomic disparities accounted for
lower rates of surveillance. Also in Europe, only 22% of HCC cases were
diagnosed by surveillance, and in one-third of cases surveillance was
indicated but missed \[11\]. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)
and alcoholic liver disease were associated with deficient surveillance,
both in America and in Europe.

22.3 High Risk Groups

For some high-risk groups of patients HCC surveillance is recommended by
current protocols, while the need for surveillance for other groups is
still debated (Table 22.1).Table 22.1Groups for which hepatocellular
carcinoma (HCC) surveillance is recommended and groups with unproven

22.3.1 Patient with Cirrhosis

Patients with liver cirrhosis are a high-risk group. The HCC incidence
rate among patients with cirrhosis has been shown to be 2--4% per year,
independently from etiology \[12, 14\]. All the guidelines strongly
recommend that patients with Child-Pugh A and B stage cirrhosis should
be entered into surveillance programs \[3--6\].

According to the general principles of surveillance, it must be
considered that the HCC incidence increases with liver disease
evolution, but also that the probability of receiving eradicative
therapies becomes lower, because of lower applicability of surgery,
tumor ablation or radioembolization. The presence of advanced liver
failure (Child-Pugh stage C) prevents effective HCC therapies from being
employed, and thus surveillance should only be performed when liver
transplantation is indicated, as HCC onset may modify both priority on
the list and transplantability \[3, 5, 6\].

22.3.2 Patient with Hepatitis B Virus Infection Without Cirrhosis

Patients with HBV infection are at risk of HCC development even in the
absence of cirrhosis, but the exact degree of risk is ill defined and
appears to be influenced by geographical region (higher in Asia and
Africa), higher levels of HBV replication, age, and gender \[15\]. These
patients are at higher risk than the general population, and are more
suitable for surgical treatments. Thus, the latest European guideline
adopts a different scoring system to stratify HBV-infected patients in
relation to their risk of developing HCC based on mixed demographic and
laboratory parameters (PAGE-B) \[16\]. Subjects with high or
intermediate risk were recommended for surveillance.

22.3.3 Patients with Hepatitis C Virus Infection and Advanced Fibrosis

In 2009, Lok and et al. showed that HCC can occur in non-cirrhotic
patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection who suffer from
advanced fibrosis \[17\]. The current availability of simple and new
non-invasive methods to assess significant (Metavir F3) fibrosis, such
as transient elastography, further simplified the inclusion of these
patients in surveillance programs \[18\]. However, the incidence of HCC
in these subjects is lower than 1.5% and their inclusion in surveillance
programs is still debated \[6\] and currently only recommended in the
EASL guidelines.

22.3.4 Patients with Non-alcoholic Steatohepatitis or Non-alcoholic
Fatty Liver Disease

The estimated prevalence of NASH in the general population ranges from 2
to 3% \[19\]. Data has revealed that up to 44% of cases of NAFLD can
progress to NASH even in the absence of inflammation at baseline \[20\]
and approximately 23% of cases of NASH progress to cirrhosis over the
following 10--15 years. The incidence of HCC in patients with NASH
cirrhosis has been reported to be 2.3--4.0% per year \[21\].

Patients with NASH cirrhosis should be considered for HCC screening
according to the guidelines of the American Hepatology and
Gastroenterology Societies based on a systematic review of NAFLD/NASH
cirrhotic patients \[22\]. However, it is estimated that half of the
cases of NASH-induced HCC arise in non-cirrhotic patients \[23\] and
there is a clear need to define which high-risk patients should undergo
surveillance. Thus, no recommendation can currently be made on the
timing of surveillance or its cost-effectiveness in non-cirrhotic
patients with NASH or NAFLD \[3, 24\].

22.3.5 Patients Successfully Treated for Hepatitis C or B Virus
Infection

The arrival of new direct-acting antiviral HCV therapy allowed for the
achievement of sustained virological response (SVR) in over 95% of
treated patients, irrespective of liver fibrosis stage \[25\]. Older
age, low platelet count, and/or presence of cirrhosis despite SVR are
associated with a higher risk for HCC development and warrant
surveillance \[26\]. There is general consensus in guidelines that
patients with cirrhosis should continue surveillance after direct-acting
antiviral-induced SVR. However, patients, providers and healthcare
systems also desperately need guidance as to whether HCC surveillance
can ever be safely discontinued after HCV eradication \[27\].

Currently, the EASL and APASL guidelines recommend maintaining
surveillance for SVR patients with advanced liver fibrosis, whereas the
AASLD does not \[28\].

Caucasian patients with HBV-related cirrhosis at the time of initiating
nucleos(t)ide analog (NUC) therapy benefit from a decrease in HCC yearly
incidence between the first 5 and second 5 years of treatment,
specifically from 3.22% to 1.57% \[29\]. Therefore, these data confirm
that surveillance is to be maintained in patients who have reached the
stage of cirrhosis, regardless of receiving effective antiviral
treatment.

22.4 Approach to Surveillance

22.4.1 Ultrasound in Combination with Serum Alpha-Fetoprotein

In the latest published guidelines, serum AFP in combination with US has
become the standard reference for HCC surveillance in high-risk
populations.

The American guidelines based their statements on the data emerging from
a systematic review of surveillance. The use of US plus AFP improved
detection of early-stage HCC compared with no surveillance. Both US
alone and US plus AFP led to similar rates of curative treatment \[30\].
Although several biases may have influenced these data, the combined
6-month interval US plus AFP was recommended by the AASLD in the HCC
surveillance setting.

The European guideline, although adopting the US plus AFP protocol as a
reference, states that the combination with AFP is not recommended in
patients with active liver inflammation, as the 6--8% gain in the
detection rate does not counterbalance the increase in false-positive
results \[31\].

22.4.1.1 Cut-Off Value of Serum Alpha-Fetoprotein Applied to
Surveillance

The optimal cut-off value of AFP for HCC surveillance should be
determined on the premise that it is examined simultaneously with US. In
a meta-analysis, AFP with a cut-off value of 200 ng/mL showed a better
combined positive likelihood ratio than that with a value of 20 ng/mL
\[32\]. AFP levels decrease according to decreased hepatitis activity in
patients with chronic HBV on antiviral treatment or HCV patients after
SVR. Thus, the APASL guidelines suggest that the cut-off value of AFP
can be set lower (down to 12--20 ng/mL) in a virologically suppressed or
eradicated population.

22.4.1.2 The Six-Month Interval

The ideal interval of surveillance for HCC should be dictated by two
main features: rate of tumor growth up to the limit of its
detectability, and tumor incidence in the target population. The median
tumor doubling time in HCC is demonstrated to be 80--117 days \[6\]. An
increased risk of developing HCC does not mean a faster tumor
progression, and thus cirrhotic patients at high risk do not require
screening at shorter time intervals.

A meta-analysis has demonstrated that the sensitivity of a 6- versus
12-month surveillance strategy increases from 50 to 70% \[31\]. In a RCT
that enrolled patients with compensated cirrhosis, no significant
difference was documented in the rate of HCC detection by using an
US-based surveillance strategy every 3 or 6 months \[33\]. Thus,
biannual US with AFP-based surveillance is currently recommended.

22.4.2 Proposed Imaging Techniques and Serology Markers for Surveillance

Despite its high diagnostic performance compared with US, magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) has not been recommended for HCC surveillance
because of prohibitive costs when widely adopted for screening patients
with cirrhosis. Non-contrast MRI also exhibits a high sensitivity for
detecting focal liver lesions when performed with sufficient sequences
to preserve superior tissue contrast \[34\], and is potentially a good
alternative surveillance tool for HCC. Non-contrast MRI has the
significant advantage of eliminating the potential risks of contrast
media, reducing costs, and improving efficiency. A multicenter clinical
trial is currently ongoing in Korea, which is comparing both annual
non-contrast liver MRI and biannual US as surveillance tools for HCC in
patients with liver cirrhosis \[35\].

Contrast-enhanced US (CEUS) is useful for characterization of
US-detected liver nodules and is as sensitive as dynamic computed
tomography (CT) or dynamic MRI in the diagnosis of HCC \[36\]. In
addition, CEUS has several advantages, and has the possibility of being
performed immediately when a suspect nodule is discovered during US
surveillance \[37\]. However, although CEUS may be used in HCC
surveillance, the lack of evidence, especially with regard to
cost-effectiveness, has led to CEUS not being considered in the current
guidelines.

Other tumor markers such as lectin-bound AFP (AFP-L3) or
des-γ-carboxyprothrombin (also known as PIVKA II) have been proposed to
be more efficacious than AFP. Neither test alone, nor the combination of
the two, was adequate for HCC surveillance because the sensitivity of
both markers was very low when evaluating efficacy and
cost-effectiveness in detecting HCC at an early stage \[38\]. Thus, at
present, the use of these markers is not recommended as part of a
surveillance strategy in guidelines.

Hepatocellular carcinomaRecurrenceIntegrated strategyMultidisciplinary
approach

23.1 Introduction

Liver resection (LR) and transplantation (LT) are curative surgical
options for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The latter, in
particular, is the best treatment option for selected patients with
early-stage disease. HCC is the fifth most common cancer type and the
third most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide \[1, 2\]. LT
could provide a long-term survival for HCC patients fulfilling the Milan
criteria, similar to the LT outcomes in patients without cancer. Despite
the restrictive selection policy, the recurrence rate of this tumor
drastically affects patient survival in up to 25% of cases \[3\]. It is
well known that the timing of recurrence after LT can represent a key
predictor of survival, and that a recurrence occurring within 24 months
(early intra- and/or extra-hepatic HCC recurrence) is frequently
associated with a worse prognosis \[4\].

Early recurrence is defined as recurrence within 2 years after resection
of HCC. From a pathophysiological perspective, this clinical entity
might result from circulating HCC cell clones engrafting and growing in
a target organ after LT or from non-detectable extra-hepatic metastases
being present before LT.

Late recurrence (beyond 2 years after surgery) is more a result of new
malignant clones and is related to underlying liver conditions (e.g.,
liver cirrhosis) \[5\]. The natural history of HCC is quite
heterogeneous and it is possible to distinguish two models of tumor
progression, depending on whether the disease develops in a cirrhotic or
a non-cirrhotic liver \[6\].

23.2 Clinical Setting and Risk Factors

The primum movens in HCC development is an insult by pathogenic noxious
agents (e.g., viruses, alcohol, aflatoxins, etc.) which damage the liver
parenchyma. Immediate elimination of the insult can result in
restoration of the normal hepatic tissue structure; if instead the
causative agent cannot be completely removed, an inflammatory process
ensues with fibrotic evolution of the liver and hepatic cell
regeneration with nodular arrangement of the cells, and consequent
formation of cirrhotic pseudonodules. This leads to subversion of the
normal hepatic architecture which will inevitably result in a functional
alteration of the liver. Subsequently, a series of genetic mutations
involving genes involved in cell apoptosis and proliferation will
follow, which will cause the bypass of the physiological mechanism of
hepatic senescence. These events will give rise to altered cell lines,
with the ability to invade vascular structures and produce distant
metastases, and therefore to the onset of permanent lesions that over
time can evolve into neoplasia. Specifically, the regenerative
pseudonodules will become dysplastic and then neoplastic \[7\].

Despite much evidence supporting the recommendations of scientific
societies around the world, the clinical manifestations of HCC are often
late, with a diagnosis that is generally made in the advanced stage of
the disease, thus significantly limiting treatment options. Based on
genomic profiling and next-generation sequencing, two distinct subgroups
of HCC (proliferative and non-proliferative) have been identified, each
with "core" genomic alterations and/or oncogenic pathways and distinct
histopathologic features and clinical outcomes. Proliferative HCC is an
aggressive phenotype with moderate to poor cellular differentiation,
high alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels, frequent vascular invasion, high
tumor recurrence, and poor outcomes. Non-proliferative HCC is a less
aggressive phenotype with well- to moderately differentiated tumor at
histologic examination, lower AFP levels, and better outcomes \[8\].

However, translation of this knowledge into clinical practice and
therapeutic decision-making has been challenging given the substantial
intra- and inter-tumor genetic heterogeneity with some mutations present
only in specific regions within the tumor, such that a single biopsy
specimen is likely to be insufficient in accurate molecular
stratification. To calculate the risk of post-LT HCC recurrence,
comprehensive machine-learning algorithms, based on serial imaging, AFP,
locoregional therapies, treatment response, and post-transplant
outcomes, were recently proposed that demonstrated higher levels of
accuracy than other risk scores for optimizing the allocation of donor
organs \[9\].

23.3 Diagnostic Tools and Oncologic Monitoring

HCC is a neoplasm for which an adequate and careful surveillance program
is essential, to diagnose the tumor at an early stage and be able to use
a greater number of therapeutic strategies, thus improving patient
outcomes \[10\]. Patients at high risk for developing HCC are those with
chronic HBV or HCV infections or even cirrhotic patients. Surveillance
should be carried out in cirrhotic patients who have eradicated HCV
infection following antiviral therapy; in all cirrhotic patients,
regardless of etiology, in Child-Pugh class A and B, and in those in
class C awaiting transplant, while no increase in survival was observed
for the other class C patients. HBV-positive non-cirrhotic patients, in
whom the annual incidence of HCC is greater than 0.2% per year, should
also be included in a surveillance program. Similarly, surveillance is
recommended in patients with chronic HCV infection and bridging fibrosis
in the absence of cirrhosis \[11\]. Liver ultrasound (US) is the most
appropriate means of surveillance available to us, with acceptable
diagnostic accuracy when used as a surveillance test (sensitivity
between 58% and 89%; specificity \>90%). US is less effective in
detecting HCC in the early stage, with a sensitivity of only 63% when
used for diagnostic purposes. The widespread use of US screening is also
due to good patient compliance, low cost, non-invasiveness and the
absence of risks. On the other hand, this method is highly dependent on
the skill of the operator and the characteristics of the patient (body
mass index ≥33, presence of ascites or bloating). With regard to
serological markers, the AFP assay is certainly the most widely used in
HCC. Persistently high values represent a risk factor for HCC
development and can be used to define high-risk populations \[12\].
However, several studies have confirmed the importance of AFP in
diagnosis but not in surveillance, since increased AFP levels in
cirrhotic patients could be associated not only with HCC development,
but also with a possible exacerbation of the underlying disease or
reactivation of HBV or HCV infection; moreover, only a small proportion
of early-stage tumors (10--20%) have high serum AFP values, a fact
recently associated with a particularly aggressive subclass of HCC. As
part of the surveillance, it was found that the combined use of AFP and
US leads to an increase in sensitivity by about 6--8% compared to US
alone, causing, however, an increase in false positives and costs. The
diagnostic accuracy for HCC of this serological test was confirmed by
retrospective case-control studies which considered the cut-off of
10--20 ng/mL to be more efficient for diagnosis, with sensitivity around
60% and specificity 80%.

Other tumor markers such as des-gamma-carboxy prothrombin (DCP) also
known as vitamin K absence-induced prothrombin, the glycosylated AFP
fraction (L3 fraction) on total AFP, alpha-fucosidase, and glypican
\[13\] were evaluated, alone or in combination, more for diagnosis and
prognosis than for surveillance. In particular, DCP levels have been
associated with portal venous invasion and an advanced tumor stage,
similarly to the levels of the AFP-L3 fraction. At present, none of
these serological tests can be recommended for the surveillance of
patients at risk of developing de novo HCC. The ideal recommended
surveillance interval is six months, since a quarterly interval does not
translate into any clinical benefit and vice versa an annual interval,
while reducing costs, is associated with fewer diagnoses of HCC at an
early stage and lower survival \[14\].

Recurrence is generally established by radiologic evidence of new tumor
on computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and
systemic treatments are warranted when it presents as or becomes
systemically spread \[2\]. In the last decade, many HCCs have been
diagnosed based on imaging features alone in patients at high risk by
using the typical radiologic features at dynamic imaging, without
histopathologic evaluation. For this reason, correlation of imaging
findings with specific molecular traits of HCC has gained substantial
interest in recent years \[15\].

Diagnostic imaging (CT and MRI) is crucial for obtaining the standard of
care for HCC evaluation, and they have a role in the preoperative
assessment to predict HCC recurrence after LT and or liver resection.
Very recently, the role of gadoxetate-enhanced MRI in differentiating
proliferative from non-proliferative HCCs was analyzed, demonstrating
that the majority of proliferative HCCs showed rim arterial enhancement,
defined as irregularly shaped rim-like peripheral enhancement, and a
large hypo-enhancing central component (50% or more area) may correlate
with larger necrotic areas. Therefore, rim arterial enhancement was
shown to predict a proliferative HCC, with reduced overall survival and
an increased rate of intra- and extra-hepatic metastases \[15\].

23.4 Clinical Decision-Making and Surgical Management

The following preoperative CT and MRI findings are specific independent
risk factors for postoperative early HCC recurrence as indicators of
microvascular invasion \[2\]:tumor size;

multifocality;

hypointensity on T1-weighted MRI sequences;

corona enhancement, hypointensity on hepatobiliary phase MRI;

peritumoral hypointensity on hepatobiliary phase;

non-smooth tumor margin;

incomplete tumor capsule;

satellite nodule;

mosaic architecture;

absence of fat in the mass;

macro-vascular invasion.

The size and number of tumors, which together represent tumor burden,
are important prognostic factors for HCC: as tumor size increases, HCCs
tend to have a higher frequency of vascular invasion, extrahepatic
metastases and a decrease in patient survival. Multifocal tumors can
represent multiple independent HCCs occurring simultaneously (multifocal
HCC) or intrahepatic metastases from a primary HCC. The availability and
success of curative treatment options, such as liver resection or
transplantation, are highly dependent on the size and number of HCCs.
Indeed, liver resection for HCC \<3 cm improves long-term patient
survival \[2\]. Intrahepatic metastases develop through two different
routes. Small satellite nodules around the primary tumor form when
cancer cells enter portal venules that drain from the primary tumor and
spread into the surrounding parenchyma. Metastatic nodules outside the
drainage area, including other segments or the contralateral lobe,
develop through the systemic circulation of cancer cells. Multifocal
tumors can have variable histological grades and other features, while
all metastatic tumors of a single HCC are considered to have advanced
lesions with advanced tumor grade. The prognosis of patients with
intrahepatic HCC metastases tends to be worse than those with multifocal
HCC.

Poorly differentiated HCCs tend to show lower signal intensity on
hepatobiliary phase MRI than well-differentiated or moderately
differentiated HCC \[15\]. Vascular invasion is more common in larger or
higher histological grade HCCs. Cancer cells involve the portal venous
system more frequently than the hepatic veins. Macrovascular invasion is
related to poor prognosis because it provides tumor cells with the
pathway to access the portal or systemic circulation, which can result
in intrahepatic or systemic metastases. Thus, vascular invasive HCCs
have frequent multifocality and a higher relapse rate after LR, ablation
therapy, or LT \[16\] (Fig. 23.1).

(HCC) in the right hepatic lobe (arrow) on axial arterial phase
contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) image. (b) The same patient
underwent hepatic resection (circle), as shown on the axial portal
venous phase contrast-enhanced CT image performed some weeks after
surgery. (c) Six months later, axial contrast-enhanced magnetic
resonance imaging in the arterial phase showed recurrent HCC along the
hepatic resection margins (arrow)

Surgical resection is regarded as the first-line treatment option for
HCC patients with well-preserved liver function. Nevertheless, almost
70% of HCC patients develop tumor recurrence within 5 years after
surgery \[5\]. Currently, the therapeutic options of HCC recurrence
include LR, particularly for isolated hepatic and extra-hepatic
metastases, and the following range of therapies:transarterial
chemoembolization or embolization (TACE or TAE);

radiofrequency and microwave thermal ablation (RFTA and MWTA);

multi-target tyrosine kinases inhibitor (sorafenib).

Limited but unresectable HCC recurrence in selected patients can be
treated with locoregional therapy, which may include TACE, TAE, MWTA,
and RFTA, with potential survival improvement, considering their
repeatability or potential combination in a multimodality approach
\[17\].

23.5 Conclusion

Managing recurrent HCC is a challenging area, as reflected by the highly
heterogeneous conditions and treatment strategies. Since molecular
classification and data from molecular analytics are not yet
incorporated into the clinical practice guidelines for HCC management or
prediction of recurrence, the evaluation of patients with HCC should
include preoperative CT or MRI, which can be used to effectively predict
early recurrence and preoperatively stratify these patients. Machine
learning techniques with deep learning approaches to extract hidden
qualitative and quantitative data from clinical images (including
texture analysis) are increasingly being studied in oncology. However,
they are challenged by repeatability and reproducibility, and they need
a large volume data for adequate stratification.

Hepatocellular carcinomaLiver biopsyLiver tumorPrimary liver
cancersCancer diagnosis

24.1 Introduction

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) accounts for approximately 90% of primary
liver cancers, and its incidence is increasing. It represents the fifth
cancer worldwide and is the third major cause of cancer death \[1\]. The
world incidence of HCC is about 15%, with geographic differences \[2\].
The literature indicates that 70--97% of patients with HCC have
underlying liver cirrhosis at the time of diagnosis \[3\].

HCC is diagnosed by non-invasive procedures, such as imaging studies and
tumor markers, and by invasive techniques, such as liver biopsy (LB). LB
involves the retrieval of a quantity of tissue from the liver by means
of a dedicated needle, and is usually performed percutaneously under
local anesthetic. This allows microscopic examination of the obtained
tissue. LB can furnish data about diagnosis, prognosis and, in certain
circumstances, it guides treatment decisions in HCC. The specificity and
sensitivity of LB diagnosis for HCC have been reported to be 100% and
around 90%, respectively, depending on location, differentiation, and
size of the lesion, as well as on the expertise of the physician
performing the biopsy and of the pathologist \[4\]. The role of LB in
the management of HCC is controversial as a result of the good
performance of imaging techniques \[5\]. Needle-tract seeding, sampling
errors and risk of morbidity are the limits of LB and, together with
imaging refinements, have changed the role of histological examination
in HCC.

24.2 Indications and Technique

LB indications continue to evolve and, although percutaneous LB of a
mass is usually possible, biopsy is not always indicated. LB is
justified when its result would influence patient management. These
indications include establishing a diagnosis before surgery, patients
who are not surgical candidates, and assessing hepatic dysfunction.

Although mainly performed percutaneously, LB can also be done through a
transjugular/transvenous, endoscopic or laparoscopic access.

24.2.1 Contraindications and Risk Factors

The approach depends on abdominal wall thickness (the percutaneous route
may be problematic in obese patients) but the presence of underlying
liver disease or cirrhosis can hamper the maneuver. Cirrhosis with
impaired coagulation parameters, ascites, severe portal hypertension,
low platelet count and hard liver could contraindicate the performance
of a LB. A platelet count \<50,000/μL is a risk factor for bleeding for
the percutaneous route, and a transjugular approach is advised in this
setting \[6\]. Technical factors could add difficulties: a deep and
posterior location of the nodule can be an insurmountable obstacle. LB
should not be performed when the obtainable results would not alter
patient's prognosis and treatment options.

24.2.2 Percutaneous Liver Biopsy

Percutaneous LB is the most widespread approach. Before the procedure,
anesthetic is injected into the skin. The procedure is carried out
through a thin needle across the skin into the liver, removing some
tissue for pathology. Percutaneous LB is performed under ultrasound (US)
or computed tomography (CT) guidance, for better accuracy and safety. As
with any invasive technique, there are risks associated with
percutaneous LB that should be assessed in advanced. The main reason for
limiting LB is the risk of complications that could have an impact on
the diagnostic and/or therapeutic pathway.

24.2.3 Transvenous/Transjugular Liver Biopsy

Indications for transvenous/transjugular LB are usually different from
those for percutaneous biopsy, thus comparison of morbidity and
mortality between these approaches may be misleading.
Transvenous/transjugular LB is carried out on patients with: (1)
ascites; (2) known or suspected clotting disorders with the risk of
bleeding; (3) a hard cirrhotic liver; (4) morbid obesity resulting in
difficulty identifying a flank site; (5) a need for preoperative hepatic
vein pressure measurement.

A flexible catheter is inserted into the jugular vein, the contrast
agent is injected into the tube and images are acquired. This allows
visualization of the hepatic vein. A biopsy needle is threaded through
the tube and samples are retrieved. Reported minor and major
complication rates were 6% and 0.5%, respectively, whereas mortality was
0.09% (hemorrhage 0.06%; ventricular arrhythmia 0.03%) \[7, 8\].

24.2.4 Endoscopic Ultrasound-Guided Liver Biopsy

Endoscopic ultrasound-guided liver biopsy (EUS-LB) may be a safe and
effective alternative that is performed by endoscopic US in the
duodenum. Several series have reported its use in performing both
targeted and non-targeted LBs, with a sensitivity of 82--94%,
specificity of 90--100% and a low complication rate (2.3%). EUS-LB is
accurate and versatile but highly operator-dependent. It can offer
higher resolution imaging detecting smaller lesions than CT or US. It is
useful for small and deep-seated left lobe lesions below CT or magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) resolution or not easily accessible
percutaneously. Evidence suggests the superiority of EUS-LB for focal
lesions, with less sampling variability in heterogeneous parenchymal
disease \[9\].

24.2.5 Laparoscopic Liver Biopsy

LB can be performed through a laparoscope during surgery under general
anesthesia. Biopsy is performed either with typical needle devices or by
wedge resection. It is used for lesions discovered accidentally at
routine surgery or because the liver is noted to be abnormal prior to
planned surgery. This procedure is used for patients with abnormal
clotting indexes and/or coagulopathy, when histology is mandatory for
treatment. The technique allows adequate tissue sampling with direct
control of bleeding. Complications in laparoscopic LB include those of
the laparoscopy itself, such as delayed bleeding from the LB site or
abdominal wall and intestinal perforation, which occur in 1.0% of cases.
Expense and requirements for special expertise limit its use \[10\].

24.2.6 Risk of Complications

LB is a safe procedure, but there are risks that need to be carefully
weighed against the advantages and the results provided. Complications
are uncommon (5.9%) and risks include bleeding, organ perforation,
sepsis and death. Bleeding occurs in about 10% of cases, and major
bleeding accounts for less than 2%. In a small number of cases, there is
some minor bleeding, especially in patients with cirrhosis who are at a
higher risk of this complication. The mortality associated with LB is
\<0.001% \[6\].

24.2.7 Risk of Tumoral Seeding

The possibility of tumor dissemination into adjacent liver tissue after
performing LB has been reappraised. Details of the prevalence of tumor
cell seeding along the needle tract, which could significantly worsen
the patient's prognosis, have yet to be established \[11\]. The reported
incidence of seeding is 0.005%, probably underestimated because most of
the reports include single cases. The interval from LB to confirmed
implantation varies from 3 months to 4 years. The treatment of
implantation has not been clearly established. Surgical resection is
reported in many cases; other treatment modalities included local
radiotherapy and radiofrequency ablation. Removal of the seeding by
surgical resection was shown to be easily performed: it does not affect
the outcomes of oncological treatment or the long-term outcomes. Some
series reported an overall survival, after surgical excision of seeding,
ranging from 3 to 5 years \[12\].

24.3 Biopsy for Diagnosis of Hepatocellular Carcinoma

Multiphasic contrast-enhanced imaging studies (CT and MRI) are employed
to effectively diagnose focal liver nodules based on their vascular and
biliary physiological features, in relation to the timing of images
obtained after contrast agent administration. Thus, LB is now rarely
required to differentiate benign from malignant lesions. The evaluation
of nodules having features of HCC is influenced by their size and
location, the state of non-neoplastic liver, the patient's clinical
condition, the imaging patterns and expertise of the diagnostic
physicians. Non-invasive diagnosis of HCC, in the setting of liver
cirrhosis, is based on typical patterns on diagnostic imaging performed
using specific contrast agents, as shown in the diagnostic algorithm
(Fig. 24.1) \[4\].

Fig. 24.1Diagnostic algorithm for a suspicious nodule in cirrhotic
patients. The role of liver biopsy in the case of a mass detected in a
cirrhotic liver is limited to those nodules without typical features at
imaging or at first liver biopsy. \* Using extracellular MR contrast

A reliable diagnosis of a liver lesion identified by US represents a
major clinical issue and it proves almost impossible for nodules \<1 cm
using the current imaging modalities. On the other hand, the diagnosis
of HCC can be confirmed using imaging techniques if a nodule larger than
1 cm displays specific imaging features. Typical patterns of HCC on
contrast-enhanced CT and MRI are intense contrast uptake during the
arterial phase followed by decreased enhancement and washout during the
portal phases, based on the theory of neo-arterial supply feeding the
HCC. A single contrast-enhanced imaging study is sufficient for the
diagnosis of HCC.

The high specificity and positive predictive value of this pattern in
larger lesions have been prospectively validated for HCC only in
cirrhotic livers. Because of their higher sensitivity and ability to
analyze the whole liver, CT or MRI should be used first. LB should be
considered in patients with nodules that are not typical at
contrast-enhanced imaging, especially for findings classed as "nodules
with features likely for HCC" or "nodules with features highly
suggestive or even diagnostic of malignancy, but not specific for HCC"
\[13\]. The specificity of the imaging hallmarks for HCC is lower in the
non-cirrhotic liver, since alternative diagnoses are seen more commonly
(e.g., hepatocellular adenoma and liver metastases).

Histological confirmation is suggested when the imaging-based diagnosis
remains inconclusive, especially in small tumors (\<2 cm), where the
features of contrast-enhanced imaging are not specific. Considering a
5--10% level of uncertainty with imaging-based HCC diagnosis, even when
the classical diagnostic parameters are satisfied, LB can be considered
whenever a higher level of certainty is required.

Despite moderate evidence, the European Association for the Study of the
Liver (EASL) recommends that the diagnosis of HCC in non-cirrhotic
livers should be confirmed using LB \[4\]. In non-cirrhotic patients,
the specificity of the imaging hallmarks is lower than in cirrhosis, as
alternative diagnoses (such as hepatocellular adenoma or hypervascular
metastases) are more common. For this reason, imaging studies are not
adequate in non-cirrhotic livers and LB is mandatory to confirm HCC.

The diagnosis of liver cirrhosis might be difficult in some cases. When
the diagnosis of HCC in patients with cirrhosis is uncertain, LB should
be carried out as in non-cirrhotic patients. LB has the additional
advantage of providing information regarding the non-neoplastic liver.
The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) does
not recommend biopsy for lesions larger than 1 cm if two different
imaging studies yield concordant findings \[14\]. LB is done with
varying degrees of sensitivity (66--93%, based on tumor size, operator
experience, and needle size) and 100% specificity and positive
predictive value \[15\].

An LB may be needed in patients who are not candidates for curative
resection, to establish a diagnosis for the purpose of systemic therapy
or liver transplantation (LT).

24.4 Biologic Information Obtainable from Biopsy

One role of LB is the enrollment in trials for new anticancer drugs or
innovative interventional therapies. Biopsy of cancers could determine
the appropriate therapy for patients affected by diseases with similar
characteristics, a possibility that has opened the door to "precision
medicine". LB has some role in the diagnosis of HCC, but its role
remains under debate. We know that HCC biopsy can accurately predict
tumor grading in patients with nodules \<5 cm subjected to liver
resection \[16\]; for larger tumors this correlation is weaker.

There are no data on the possibility to diagnose microscopic vascular
invasion, which is a prognostic factor of HCC associated with advanced
tumor stage, distant metastases and adverse outcome \[1\].

Attempts made to identify indications for surgery on the basis of
biomolecular characteristics of HCC \[17\] have never led to
modifications of the indications for treatment, which remains based on
morphological criteria, namely tumor number and size, and the recently
added serum tumor markers such as alpha-fetoprotein. There are still no
biological or mutational factors able to identify types of cancer with
different prognosis, for which different therapies can be indicated.
Thus, the usefulness of LB in terms of determining the prognosis of the
individual patient is still substantially nil.

24.5 Role of Biopsy for Surgical Resection of Hepatocellular Carcinoma

Liver resection represents the first option in patients with very early
and early HCC with a preserved liver function. It has been reported that
the accuracy of liver nodule differentiation without biopsy was adequate
at least for lesions larger than 2 cm. Biopsy findings are only
occasionally not confirmed at surgery. LB has limits in its diagnostic
power and this fact may delay proper patient management. An appropriate
indication for surgery is achievable without biopsy in 97.9% of patients
\[18\].

24.6 Role of Biopsy for Liver Transplantation in Hepatocellular
Carcinoma

The role of LB in the setting of LT is more intriguing. It has been well
stated that LT is the best treatment for HCC, as it treats the cancer
and the underlying liver disease simultaneously. Nevertheless, we live
in an era of persistent scarcity of organs for LT, and we still have to
manage the single patient as well as the LT waiting list as a whole.

The most important issues in this respect are the criteria for inclusion
on the waiting list, reduction of the dropout rate, the possibility of
performing effective bridge treatments, and prioritization of the
patients when organs become available.

Biological factors related to the nature of the HCC itself would be of
great help in those difficult decisions. There have been several
attempts in this direction. In a single-center experience, when poorly
differentiated HCC cases at pre-LT biopsy were excluded from LT, 38% of
patients did not meet the Milan criteria and 42% were TNM stages III and
IV. The 5-year actuarial survival rate was 75% and recurrence-free
survival was 92%. HCC recurred in only three patients (6%). The
conclusion was that routine pre-LT tumor grading may represent a tool in
the selection of HCC patients for LT \[19\]. In this series, the timing
of diagnosis, the Milan criteria, and the TNM stage revealed no
statistically significant impact on overall and recurrence-free survival
rates. This experience did not have any follow-up, and the indications
for LT are still based on the morphology of the tumor. Attempts have
been published to refine these criteria by including the response to
therapy carried out while waiting for the LT \[20\] or surrogates of
biological factors, such as tumor markers \[21\]. Performing a LB for
the presence of an HCC plays a small role, being limited to nodules that
appear of uncertain nature at radiology. The aim is always to define the
morphological stage of the tumor and therefore to classify it in
relation to the criteria for inclusion in the LT-waiting list.

24.7 Conclusions

Percutaneous LP is an established and safe diagnostic tool for the
diagnosis of suspicious nodules that do not exhibit typical features on
CT and/or MRI scans. The complications of LB are rare and easily
manageable. The declining interest for biopsy is related to several
issues, including morbidity due to the most frequent complications (pain
and bleeding), especially in cirrhotic patients. Seeding is an issue
that should be taken into consideration, particularly in patients who
would benefit from LT. There are two drawbacks of the limited use of LB
for HCC diagnosis. The systematic avoidance of biopsy for the diagnosis
of HCC may have slowed progress in understanding the biologic features
of these tumors and in developing targeted therapies. The decision to
obtain a biopsy should be taken after discussion in a multidisciplinary
tumor board including radiologists, surgeons, oncologists, pathologists
and hepatologists. Broader availability of LB in HCC has the potential
to provide greater access to clinical trials, expand the treatment
options and support research measures expected to improve the therapy of
liver cancers.

25.1 Introduction

Liver resection is considered a major abdominal surgery. Chronic
hepatitis C is still the leading cause of chronic liver disease (CLD)
and is implicated in the increase in cases of hepatocellular carcinoma
(HCC). Today, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and alcoholic
liver disease represent the second leading etiology for liver disease.
Primary NAFLD is associated with insulin resistance and metabolic
syndrome: obesity, type II diabetes, arterial hypertension, and
hypertriglyceridemia \[1\].

In the 1970s, perioperative mortality for hepatic resection was about
20%, mostly because of uncontrollable bleeding and postoperative liver
failure. Moreover, patients with liver disease such as cirrhosis have
higher rates of complications and mortality. In referral centers, the
mortality associated with liver resections has decreased to less than
2%, but postoperative adverse events are still high (20--50%) \[2\].

The Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) Society has recently
published guidelines for fast-track management of patients undergoing
liver resection \[3\]. Although improvements in surgical and anesthetic
techniques have allowed perioperative mortality to be reduced, patients
with liver disease have significantly higher complication and mortality
rates. The collaboration between the surgeon and anesthesiologist is key
for a successful outcome.

25.2 Preoperative Evaluation and Assessment of Liver Disease Severity

25.2.1 Risk Scores

The liver is fundamental in many physiologic functions and in drug
metabolism; furthermore, it synthetizes coagulation factors and plasma
proteins. It plays a central role in elimination of endogenous and
exogenous substances and in maintaining perioperative homeostasis.

Several studies have investigated the risk of surgery in patients with
cirrhosis \[4, 5\]. These patients with CLD need particular
consideration during the preoperative evaluation, because different
systems can be affected.

The ESA (European Society of Anesthesiology) and ESC (European Society
of Cardiology) classify liver resection and biliary duct surgery as
having a high risk for perioperative cardiac events, with an estimated
30-day cardiac event rate of more than 5% \[6\]. Cardiac evaluation
should assess the ability of the system to respond to hemodynamic
changes, intraoperative fluid restriction adopted to achieve a low
central venous pressure (CVP), vasopressor infusion, and vascular
exclusion during liver resection. In the past medical history, it is
important to evaluate a previous neoadjuvant chemotherapy, which can
reduce functional cardiac reserve, and may be a cause of elevation of
CVP; moreover it induces damage to sinusoidal integrity (sinusoidal
obstruction syndrome) that eventually increases the risk of
intraoperative bleeding \[7\]. Thus, the cardiologic preoperative
evaluation should include a resting echocardiography examination,
although exercise or stress echocardiography may be useful to determine
the contractile reserve.

The ASA score (American Society of Anesthesiology physical status
classification system) is a simple tool adopted for the preoperative
evaluation of surgical patients, but it does not consider specific
issues of liver surgery and CLD (Table 25.1).Table 25.1Scores used to
calculate surgical risk in patients with liver disease

Model of End-stage Liver Disease

The presence or absence of cirrhosis is the key to understanding and
predicting outcomes in liver resections, and this stratification depends
on the degree of hepatocellular dysfunction \[8\]. The
Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) and Model of End-stage Liver Disease (MELD)
scores are extensively used to stratify liver disease severity. The CTP
score emphasizes the sequela of portal hypertension \[9\]. In
particular, the CTP score can be used to predict postoperative
mortality: 10% in Child A, 17--30% in Child B, and 60--80% in Child C
(Table 25.1).

When a patient with CLD is evaluated for surgery, the MELD score is also
widely used \[10\]; MELD quantifies the degree of liver damage, the
degree of portal hypertension and the renal impairment \[11\], and it is
an independent predictor of mortality. When the MELD score is higher
than 8, for each additional point there is a 14% increase in mortality
in 30--90 days \[12\] (Table 25.1).

25.2.2 Portal Hypertension

The type and anatomic site of the surgical procedure are important in
risk stratification; if the anatomic resection involves three or more
segments, as in major hepatectomy, the assessment of perioperative risk
and the anesthesiologic approach and support are crucial. Yet, bleeding
remains a major complication, and the hepatic veins are a significant
source of bleeding.

Hepatic resection for HCC is typically considered in patients without
portal hypertension; a hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) \<10
mmHg, no venous collaterals on abdominal computed tomography, and no
esophageal varices can confirm the absence of portal hypertension. A
surrogate marker for the absence of portal hypertension is a platelet
count \>100,000/μL \[13\]. A platelet count ≤120,000/μL, creatinine
level ≥2 mg/dL, and INR ≥1.1 have been identified as a relevant risk
factor.

25.3 General Anesthesia

Anesthesiologic procedures in liver surgery are the same as those for
other major operations and the patient's preparation is crucial. The
surgical position of the patient plays a fundamental role in the case of
laparoscopic or robotic approaches, for the extremely unphysiological
position that may be adopted and for accessibility to the surgical
field.

Maintenance of the patient's homeothermy during major surgical
intervention is necessary and is associated with ERAS, especially in the
case of major hepatectomies; hypothermia plays a fundamental role in the
coagulation process, which may be further impaired by major liver
resection or bleeding. In major liver surgery, intraoperative active
warming measures are mandatory, including the application of forced-air
convection systems, the adoption of circulating-water mattresses
connected to a warming unit and infusion fluid heating systems \[3\].

Another important aspect is the recruitment and accessibility of venous
accesses that must be adequate for the procedure as well as easily
manageable and reachable. A central venous access must be placed to
ensure catecholamine infusion, as well as to maintain CVP monitoring.

General anesthesia is mandatory, and the choice of short-acting drugs is
preferred.

The decreased functional mass of hepatocytes after liver resection and
Pringle maneuver can lead to a reduction in metabolism and hepatic
clearance of the drugs. Factors that affect hepatic clearance include
blood flow to the liver, the fraction of the drug unbound to plasma
proteins, and intrinsic clearance. Moreover, the increase in the free
fraction of a drug leads to enhanced effects.

The metabolism of benzodiazepines may be significantly altered, and
their effect can be prolonged, so it is questioned if their routine use
for preoperative anxiolysis is useful.

General anesthesia can be maintained with volatile anesthetics
(isoflurane, sevoflurane or desflurane), intravenous anesthetics
(propofol, ketamine, remifentanil), alone or in combination. No
significant advantages have been demonstrated when comparing intravenous
versus inhaled anesthesia. It is generally suggested to use a low dose
of opioids with longer dosing intervals. Cisatracurium as a muscle
blockade is often preferred owing to its Hofman elimination. Careful
monitoring of the degree of neuromuscular blockade is mandatory.

25.3.1 Vascular and Bleeding Control and Hemodynamic Monitoring

The liver receives around 25% of the cardiac output (CO); 70% is
supplied by the portal vein, while the remaining 30% comes from the
hepatic artery. This dual perfusion is fundamental for the liver's
function and provides a constant oxygen supply. Several surgical
techniques can be adopted to reduce blood loss. The Pringle maneuver,
consisting of intermittent clamping of the hepatic hilum has been shown
to provide protection from damage due to the ischemia-reperfusion
injury. The Pringle maneuver is chosen as the main option; during
hepatic hilum clamping the afterload increases by 20--30% so the CO
could fall up to 10%.

Total vascular exclusion is the most effective vascular control, but
this technique induces hemodynamic instability as it is associated with
a sharp decrease in venous return and high vascular resistance,
requiring aggressive hemodynamic management. Cross-clamping of the
inferior vena cava and portal vein result in a 40--60% reduction of
venous return and CO, with a compensatory increase in vascular
resistances (80%) and heart rate (50%) \[14\]. In particular conditions,
when total vascular exclusion is necessary for the resection of tumor
involving the vena cava, a venovenous bypass (usually
caval-portal-jugular) must be performed. This technique achieves stable
hemodynamics and optimal venous drainage of both kidneys, and it reduces
both splanchnic congestion and bleeding. Nowadays, percutaneous
cannulation of the femoral vein and internal jugular vein will be
performed \[15\].

Given the above, it is very important to use hemodynamic monitoring for
this operation, and a peculiar issue regards monitoring of the CVP \[16,
17\].

ERAS protocols recommend CVP monitoring for fluid management. A low CVP
can be obtained by a limitation of fluid input and nitrate infusion to
reach the target, when necessary. A mechanical ventilation strategy with
4--6 mL/kg and PEEP \<5 cmH2O can help to achieve a low CVP. Also
important is the invasive and continuous monitoring of the patient's
blood pressure; goal-directed therapy allows one to maintain a better
organ perfusion and O2 delivery; goal-directed therapy can also direct
and individualize intraoperative fluid management and catecholamine use.
CO, stroke volume (SV) and stroke volume variation (SVV) can be used to
assess fluid responsiveness and to guide vasopressor administration. SVV
is based on heart-lung interactions during mechanical ventilation;
respiratory-induced changes in the left ventricular preload and result
in cyclic changes in the left ventricular SV and arterial pressure.
Today, routine monitoring of CO is available with a non-calibrated pulse
contour system (FloTrac, Vigileo) and calibrated pulse contour methods
(PICCO2, PULSION Medical Systems, EV1000, LiDCO Rapid, CardioQ-ODM+).
Some situations can limit the interpretation of pulse pressure variation
and SVV: cardiac arrhythmias, decreased lung compliance and right or
left ventricular failure. Further studies are mandatory to establish the
impact of laparoscopic surgery, especially the effect of prone
positioning and pneumoperitoneum on thoracic compliance. The pulmonary
catheter, which remains the gold standard for invasive hemodynamic
monitoring in liver transplantation, as it ensures continuous assessment
of pulmonary pressure and wedge pressure, does not, under normal
circumstances, appear necessary for major liver surgery. The normal
range of SVV under controlled ventilation is less than 10--13%. During
the resection phase, a SVV of 10--15% can be accepted, while a SVV ≤10%
after liver resection represents the target \[18, 19\].

25.3.2 Acid-Base Issues

During liver resections, some factors can contribute to a metabolic
derangement, in particular to lactic acidosis. Serum lactate, a
metabolic index of tissue perfusion, is a marker of lower oxygen
delivery and is cleared by the hepatocytes. Serum lactate concentration
and its clearance seems to be a strong predictor of outcomes following
liver resection. Tissue perfusion and hemodynamic optimization must be
the target to facilitate lactate restoration. Sodium bicarbonate is not
recommended, but it is useful in cases of severe acidosis, renal failure
and liver impairment \[20\].

25.3.3 Coagulation and Blood Products

The liver is the primary synthetic site of coagulation; procoagulant,
anticoagulant, fibrinolytic and antifibrinolytic factors are elaborated.
Cirrhotic patients are in a particular coagulation balance; deficits in
procoagulant factors are contrasted by deficits in anticoagulant
proteins synthesized by the liver; when protein C is progressively
reduced, this deficiency leads to a thrombophilic state. These patients
are not necessarily predisposed to severe bleeding. The INR is not
predictive of bleeding complications, and prophylactic preoperative
fresh frozen plasma is not recommended \[21\].

Thrombocytopenia in cirrhotic patients is due to splenic entrapment, and
it indicates the degree of portal hypertension. Moreover, the liver
synthetizes thrombopoietin, a function that is impaired in cirrhotic
livers. Generally, a platelet count higher than 50,000/μL is adequate to
allow clot formation. Prophylactic platelet transfusion is unlikely to
be beneficial. Protocol transfusion strategies based on preoperative
platelet count and INR are generally ineffective in reducing
perioperative bleeding. Moreover, they expose the patient to
transfusion-related complications, volume overload, and unexpected
thrombosis \[21\]. Viscoelastic testing (thromboelastography and
thromboelastometry) is useful to guide intraoperative transfusions and
has been shown to decrease the need for red blood cell and plasma
transfusion, especially in cirrhotic patients.

A restrictive strategy of red blood transfusion has been associated with
a better outcome: Makuuchi et al. suggested that the cut-off value of
hematocrit to start blood transfusion should be 30% intraoperatively and
20% postoperatively \[22\].

25.4 Pain Control

The complexity, potential adverse events and the derangement of liver
function during the first postoperative days, as well as pain control
following liver resection, require careful consideration.

Opiates must be used at lower than standard doses; tramadol can be used.
Acetaminophen is recommended at a dose not exceeding 2 g daily, even if
it is generally contraindicated in cirrhotic patients. Non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs can impair renal blood flow in cirrhotic
patients and can compromise coagulation.

Thoracic epidural analgesia is controversial in major liver surgery,
because of possible derangement in postoperative coagulation and
hypotension that may require fluid infusion. As advised in the ERAS
guidelines, a multimodal approach is preferred. Postoperative pain
control can be ensured by intravenous patient-controlled analgesia \[3,
24\].

In a multimodal approach, a transversus abdominis plane block and
erector spine block can be considered, although a hematoma is likely to
form \[3, 23\].

25.5 Postoperative Course

Major liver resection can be affected by significant complications.

Normally the increasing blood supply to the regenerating liver is
associated with increased splanchnic blood flow and CO. If ascites
develops in the first 2 days, a hypovolemic state can arise.

A persistent elevation in serum transaminase and phosphatase levels
needs attention because it can suggest hepatic ischemia. Another
important issue is the urea level: a low urea level reveals a liver
dysfunction. According to the ERAS guidelines, postoperative nutrition
and early oral intake are advisable, and supplemental nutrition is
indicated in malnourished patients or in prolonged postoperative
fasting. Particular attention should be paid to hyperglycemia after
major hepatic surgery; it can result from a transient insulin resistance
and from a compromised peripheral glucose uptake. There is a close
relationship between postoperative insulin sensitivity and
intraoperative insulin therapy; moreover, during surgery and the Pringle
maneuver there is a rapid change in glucose concentration relating to
hepatocyte hypoxia. Furthermore, a high level of lactate during the
early postoperative phase can be related to a mix of insulin resistance
and ischemia-reperfusion syndrome. On the other hand, in high-risk
patients and in large resections, hypoglycemia is possible and requires
glucose infusion and periodic control \[3\].

Renal function can be impaired in postoperative liver resections.
Secondary hyperaldosteronism resulting in sodium and water retention
with consequent edema can occur. Volume expansion can be obtained, if
necessary, with albumin 20% solution. Peptic ulcer prophylaxis with a
proton pump inhibitor is recommended \[3\]. Measurement of blood ammonia
can be helpful in cases of encephalopathy and when the diagnosis is
unclear.

25.6 Conclusion

A skilled medical team with experience in treating cirrhotic patients is
necessary to ensure the best treatment in such a complex surgery. The
current total morbidity in hepatic resection remains approximately
15--20%, with a mortality rate of 3--5%. When the size and health of the
remnant liver is not enough, post-hepatectomy liver failure may occur.
Only a meticulous preoperative evaluation, the right surgical
indication, and intraoperative optimization with careful postoperative
care can reduce morbidity in this surgical procedure.
