**Introduction**

Liver cancer is the fifth most common cancer in men and the seventh in
women \[1\]. World-wide incidence is between 250,000 and 1,000,000 new
cases per year with a male-female ratio of about 4 or 5:1
\[2\].Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most often primary cancer of
the liver, accounting from 85% till 90% of all primary liver cancers
\[3\].Its occurrence reaches a peak at approximately 70 years of age
with a rarely occurrence before the age of 40 years. Major risk factors
for HCC include chronic alcohol consumption, hepatitis B, hepatitis C
and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease \[3\]. Other, less common

causes are Wilson's disease, hereditary hemochromatosis,
alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency, primary biliary cirrhosis and autoimmune
hepatitis \[4,

> 5\]. The incidence of HCC in different regions of the world varies due
> to the incidence of the risk factors. Such countries are China,
> sub-Saharan Africa, Hong Kong and Taiwan with more than 15 cases per
> 100,000 populations per year \[6\]. Any agent leading to chronic
> hepatic injury and eventually cirrhosis has been associated with HCC.
> Although multiple etiologic factors are responsible for HCC, it has
> been made a significant progress in these past years in the
> understanding of the molecular mechanisms and the pathogenesis of this
> disease. This article provides an overview of this disease based on
> our extensive review of relevant literature. We will summarize the
> current risk factors, diagnosis, staging and the management of HCC.

> Global variation of the incidence of HCC is in relation with the

**Risk factors**

Almost 50% of all cases of HCC are associated with HBV infection and 25%
are associated with HCV \[9\]. HBV is double-stranded DNA-containing
virus that is able to integrate its DNA into the hepatic cells, act as a
mutagenic agent and cause secondary chromosomal rearrangement and
increasing genomic instability \[10\]. This is the reason why the risk
of HCC development is 100-fold higher for patients who are infected with
HBV in comparison with those who are not infected \[11\].

Major cause of HCC in Europe, Japan, Latin America and the United States
is cirrhosis caused by hepatitis C virus infection and the annual
incidence ranges from 2% to 8% \[9, 10\].GenerallyHCV-infected patients
have 17 fold higher risk of developing HCC than uninfected \[11-13\].HCV
is an RNA-containing virus, unable to integrate into the host genome and
